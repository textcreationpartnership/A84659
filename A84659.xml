            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This when I had finiſhed, and conſidered that
<pb facs="tcp:169899:4"/>the generall ſubject of the whole work was love, and the ſeverall parts thereof might tend to the better ordering of a Godly, Moral and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil life, I knew not unto whom more fitly to recommend it, as the Legacy of a dying man, then to you my dear children, the living Cions of my Corporall ſtock, and the comfortable cares of my drooping age, and this I do the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath unto you, as confident that you like <hi>Noahs</hi> good children, will not onely turn your own eyes from your fathers nakedneſs (in this his undertaking) but as much as in you is, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to cover the ſame from others.</p>
            <p>But that which eſpecially invites me to addreſs this tract unto you, is that you may not only be put in minde (ſo far as God ſhall inable you) to imitate your father, in <hi>Holy Love,</hi> whereby I may ſeem to revive and live again in you, but that making your ſelves firſt Scholars and followers, and then having your hearts repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the Spirit of Love, and your feet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted in the right paths of Charity you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come guides of others unto the <hi>heavenly Canaan.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> The diviſion of Love into its kinds.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which is moſt pleaſing and delightfull to the Soule and Nature of man, next unto God, is <hi>Love.</hi> Of which I intending to ſpeak, (by way of Preface) I muſt tell you that there are <hi>two kinds of Love;</hi> the one <hi>metaphorically</hi> ſo termed, which is that <hi>naturall inclination</hi> in things inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate, and irrationall, whereby they are moved according to that, which may moſt work to their reſt, or better being. By the power and ſtrength of this Love, the fire aſcends, the earth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends, the aire and water ever ſtrive to attaine and reach their own Region, or place; wherein, and where, (never till then) they are at reſt.</p>
               <p>And I may not altogether improperly call that quality, ſtrength, or vertue, Love; which doth ſo unite, and knit all the parts of this great world (the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe</hi>) together, that without it, both it, and all the parts thereof, would ſoon be diſſolved and come to nothing, of what they are.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:169899:7"/>An ancient <hi>Philoſopher</hi> called this kinde of love, <hi>unity;</hi> and to this loving unity, other Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers attributed ſo much, that they conceived the whole world, and all in it, to be nothing elſe but that, or but one entire thing; which, though conſiſting of many various and different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are yet by Love collected, drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and knit into <hi>one;</hi> which ſo long as it holds to be <hi>one,</hi> becomes incorruptible.</p>
               <p>What is Muſick, but an <hi>harmony</hi> or <hi>conſonancy</hi> of various diſcordant ſounds? What's health, but a <hi>temper</hi> or accord of the <hi>elements</hi> and parts of the body? Some write that the ſtone <hi>Tuces,</hi> if broken, though then leſſe weighty, ſinketh; but, ſo long as it is one, whole and intire, then, and ſo long it ſwimmeth, and keeps from ſinking under water: and the like power hath <hi>love</hi> and <hi>unity</hi> in all other bodies.</p>
               <p>Conſider and know, that if the Almighty <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect</hi> of the world had not breathed or infuſed a ſpirit of <hi>unity</hi> into the upper and <hi>celeſtiall parts</hi> with the <hi>inferiour elementary,</hi> that theſe had ſoon been ſcorched, and indeed conſumed by thoſe. Again, the inferiour parts ever ſtand in need, and crave the help, benefit, or <hi>influence</hi> of thoſe above them, as the earth of the water, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the aire, the aire of the fire, and the fiery <hi>element</hi> of the Heavens; in which if one <hi>Sphere</hi> ſhould thwart, and not gently yeeld to the others <hi>influence</hi> or motion, they, as the inferiour world, would ſuddenly periſh and be conſumed.</p>
               <p>The great <hi>Creator</hi> of theſe, and all things in, and under them,<note place="margin">Geneſis 1.31.</note> gave not the high praiſe and title of <hi>very good</hi> unto them, untill himſelf, by his moſt admirable power and goodneſſe,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.31.</note> had united them by <hi>love,</hi> and ſo made them all one. I cannot but acknowledge, the ſaying of that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169899:7"/>Philoſopher to be good and wiſe, who called this kinde of love, the <hi>Soul of the world.</hi> For, as the ſoule gives life and motion unto the body: ſo doth <hi>love</hi> unto all other things; and as the ſoule cheriſheth and enlightens the bodie: ſo doth love beautifie and inrich the world.</p>
               <p>In a word, there is no creature, nor part of the world, either great or ſmall, but hath, if not all, yet the greateſt part of its perfection, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, or continuance from this <hi>love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beſides this kinde of love hitherto ſpoken of, which in unreaſonable creatures may more ſtrictly be called <hi>inclination;</hi> there is a love pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo termed, which hath its working in the will, both of God, Angels, and men. <hi>Parmeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> (though an <hi>Heathen</hi>) could ſay, That love in God preceded the <hi>Chaos,</hi> or the creation of the world, as cauſing and making both. Take this love as in man, and then hear another <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher</hi> call it, the <hi>Pilot;</hi> a ſecond, the <hi>Sun;</hi> a third, the <hi>guide</hi> and <hi>director</hi> of the will of man, and of all his choice actions.</p>

               <p>For the ſoule of man hath <hi>two great powerfull faculties,</hi> called by Philoſophers, the <hi>concupiſcible</hi> and the <hi>iraſcible.</hi> In that are <hi>love, hate, deſire, fear, joy,</hi> and <hi>ſorrow,</hi> ariſing from the preſence or abſence of ſomething or other, which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truly or apparently good. And according as the <hi>concupiſcible</hi> part is affected with grief, want, or loſſe of that which is deſired: ſo, more or leſſe, the <hi>iraſcible</hi> part is inflamed or incenſed to the proſecution or revenge of the affronts or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reavings of the ſouls deſire. S. <hi>Baſil</hi> compared this <hi>paſſion</hi> unto the Shepherds dog, more valued by him, then many of his ſheep; not for that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169899:8"/>the dog hath any wooll, or gives any milk, but becauſe by his watchfulneſſe and barking, he defendeth the flock from the wolf; and ſo the <hi>concupiſcible</hi> faculty, or part of the ſoule, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to it ſelf matter of delight and content, and the <hi>iraſcible</hi> removeth or converteth the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences and difficulties which croſſe or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne this deſire. And theſe are the <hi>two wings</hi> wherewith mans ſoule flyeth in the purſuit of great <hi>Acts,</hi> and without which, ſhe appears as a Galley unoared, and a bird unwinged, each un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to move or help it ſelf.</p>
               <p>A certain Philoſopher hath compared the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a man, to a Coach drawn with two hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Conceive them to be <hi>love of good,</hi> and <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of evill.</hi> But conſidering that they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, and oft-times unruly, God hath aſſigned them a diſcreet guide, that is, <hi>reaſon,</hi> to rule and govern them. <hi>Seneca</hi> the Philoſopher, calleth this the <hi>Guardian:</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> termeth it, the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Mover</hi> of all our actions, be they good or evill, as having tied at its girdle the keyes of all our wills and affections.</p>
               <p>Betwixt <hi>love</hi> and <hi>concupiſcence</hi> ſome put this difference: 1. That <hi>concupiſcenſe</hi> aimeth at a ſuppoſed good that is abſent: but <hi>love,</hi> both at the abſent and preſent. 2. <hi>Concupiſcence,</hi> after the having and enjoying the thing deſired, (as being ſatisfied) groweth cold, or ceaſeth for the preſent to deſire: whereas <hi>love,</hi> by poſſeſſing and injoying, increaſeth, and is more ardent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the thing beloved. For the poſſeſſion or enjoyment of the thing beloved, ſerveth as fuell to continue and increaſe the flame or fire: whereas things deſired by a <hi>concupiſcence,</hi> being injoyed, die, and are often reſolved into the ſmoak of diſgrace, or the aſhes of hate.</p>

                     </gap>.6.</note> Tis true, that all earthly things ſubmit to the power of <hi>death;</hi> the young as the old, the King as the Peaſant, the rich as the poor, the wiſe as the fool. Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and ſpades are both alike to death. All know this truth; would we did but half ſo well conſider and prepare for it.</p>
               <p>And as the <hi>juriſdiction</hi> of death, ſo is that of love, <hi>univerſall.</hi> None ever eſcaped the flames of this fire; not the Supremacy of the King, not the holineſſe of the Prophet, both proved in <hi>David:</hi> not the gravity of the high Prieſt, verified in <hi>Eli</hi> to his ſons; not the wiſdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> nor the ſtrength of <hi>Samſon;</hi> all owe <hi>homage,</hi> and pay their <hi>tribute</hi> to Love, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Solomon</hi> compared Loves force, to the power of death, he ſo compared it, becauſe he could finde no one thing ſo ſtrong, to which he might have likened it. And if with the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> there had been in their expreſſions any comparative degrees, I conceive <hi>Solomon</hi> would, as well he might, have ſaid, That Love is ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then Death; which will eaſily appear, if we compare the powerfull acts of Love, with thoſe of Death.</p>
               <p>For the power of Death is ſeen in that (as is before ſaid) Kings, wiſe, rich, ſtrong, young,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:169899:9"/>all ſtoop and ſubmit to the ſtroak of <hi>Death</hi> Nay, it you ſay further, That Death adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon, yea, and prevailed over the Son of God, the <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>life</hi> of the world: yet know, that all this was done, neither could it have been done, but onely by the Love of Him, who ſubmitted himſelf to this Death. For <hi>love</hi> it was, and onely love, that wreſtled with God, and overcame him in this, that he ſhould leave the Heavens, and lay down his life, ſubmitting himſelf to that death, which had no power over him, but through his own unſpeakable love. So that I may truly ſay, That all Deaths atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are but weakeneſs, in compariſon of this Love.</p>
               <p>Might I not adde to this, that it was <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>love alone,</hi> that brought down God himſelf from Heaven, to be incarnate in the wombe of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to ſuffer all the miſeries and hardneſſe to which humane nature (not <hi>ſinfull</hi>) is ſubject? to endure weather, travail, hunger, thirſt, fear, yea, the ſadneſſe of ſoule, even unto death, and to a kinde of expoſtulation with his Father, <hi>My God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> and, in concluſion of all, to ſuffer his glorious body to be nailed to the Croſſe, and there, by direfull long tormentings, to linger out his life? and what were all theſe ſufferings, but ſo many tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of his <hi>love?</hi> and may I not cry out, O the power of Love! triumphing (with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and in a right ſenſe be it ſpoken) over God himſelf?</p>
               <p>You have in a glaunce or ſhadow, as it were, ſeen ſome glimpſe of <hi>Loves</hi> power in God; will you now ſee, how it hath wrought on men? where to rehearſe the many great affronts diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, perſections, ſuffered by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:169899:10"/>and by other the <hi>glorious company</hi> of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and the <hi>noble Army of Martyrs:</hi> were to write Volumes greater then have been ſeen yet. In cloſe of all, we muſt conclude, that all thoſe glorious <hi>Martyrdoms</hi> were performed by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Faith, through Love.</p>
               <p>It were eaſie to inlarge the hiſtory of Loves power, ſhould I tell you, that Love oft-times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth the greateſt Commands, wiſeſt Edicts, and beſt Laws, deſpiſeth honour, neglects fame, wealth, health, life, ſoul, and all: yea, and perverteth the very courſe of nature; ſuch is the unruly and untamed diſpoſition and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Love. It makes the weak dare and to encounter the ſtrong, and the coward, the moſt valiant. In a word, it turns the hen, having chickens, to become an Eaglet, and a timerous Doe, as a couragious Lion.</p>
               <p>Love by many is rightly compared to fire, the moſt active, and ſtrongeſt worker of all the <hi>Elements,</hi> which deſtroyeth houſes, Caſtles, Towns, Cities, which melteth and conſumeth the hardeſt Metals; and ſuch is, and ſo oft-times works, <hi>Love.</hi> Which as it moſt takes and works by idleneſſe, and converſe: ſo is it beſt reſiſted by the contraries, good imployment, and the ſhunning wanton company.</p>

               <p>True love hath hands, and no mouth: whereas the falſe hath only a tongue to prate, but no hands to act. Some Ancients therefore portrayed Love, with the finger on the mouth, as ſparing of words: but naked, as having diſtributed, and given all away unto his very skin. And, our moſt bleſſed Saviour after his reſurrection, ſhewed unto his Diſciples his <hi>ſide</hi> and his <hi>hands</hi> pierced, that, by that fountain, and theſe chanels, his love might appear to them, and to all the world. <hi>S.

               <p>I Speak not this of <hi>carnall,</hi> or <hi>politick love,</hi> which is uſually changeable, and inconſtant, and accompanied with falſity, tending to ſelf-ends; but of <hi>Divine love,</hi> and of this I may truly ſay, the greater or leſſer the affection is, ſuch, more, or leſſe is the perfection acquired.</p>
               <p>The bleſſed Apoſtles, and holy Martyrs in the primitive times, give us ample teſtimony, and proof to this aſſertion, whoſe revilings, and moſt exquiſite tortures, begot in them not pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience only, but delight, and pleaſure; the ſtones thrown at the Proto-martyr <hi>Stephens</hi> head, he eſteemed, as ſo many jewels. The fire under <hi>Laurence,</hi> was to him, as ſome pretious balme, or ſoveraigne confection. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who ſo much longed, to be torn in pieces by wild beaſts, ſaid, <hi>If they be tame, I will provoke them; for I am as wheat to be bruiſed, broken, and to be ſerved up to my Lords table.</hi> And <hi>S.

               <p>And, in all this, they did but as ſcholars imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate

                  <hi>with Chriſt, in God:</hi> where love to God hath morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Lover, as to the body, and to the world; and, makes him live by, and in Chriſt: for truly the ſoule cannot be thought, or ſaid to live, but
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:169899:14"/>where it appears to move, or work. Hereupon, ſome wittily have pronounced, that the beloved is become an homicide, and guilty of murder, if he return not love, for love; but robs the Lover of his ſoul, not returning his again to the Lover.</p>
               <p>And ſome <hi>Philoſophers</hi> have conceived, that, the ſoul of a dead friend by a ſtrange tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration, hath been ſecretly conveighed into the body of a friend living, and there kept alive, and operating: and all this to be effected, and brought to paſſe by the ſpirituall power of love. <hi>S.

               <p>Every one therefore it ſtrongly behoveth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to conſider, before he ſetleth, upon what he intends to ſet his love: for if on earth, he becomes earthly; if fleſh, fleſhly; if heaven, heavenly; which agreeth well with thoſe terms given in holy Scriptures, to ſeverall kinds of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate lovers.

               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid, that a friend is like a good looking-glaſſe, in, and by which, the other friend may ſee himſelf; and be ſeen by others: for ſo it was in <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> that who ſaw the one, diſcerned the other.</p>
               <p>Or, you ſhall find two friends united by true love, to be like the mother and the child; where if the child ſmile, or weep, the mother doeth the like: and as the <hi>Chamelcon</hi> appeareth to be of that colour with the thing to which it is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; ſo is it with good, and true lovers; who like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> twins looked, laughed, cried, each as the other, and were of like colour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and paſſion each as other; ſo that the union of friends made by ſincere love, is well compared and preſented by inoculating a bud into another ſtock, whereby it is made one with it.</p>
               <p>Now in man there be <hi>three unions,</hi> and each of them cauſed or bottomed on love: the firſt is that of the ſoule and body matched together by a naturall love.

                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4.3.</note> the former of theſe is wrought by a naturall, the other by a ſpirituall love. The third union is that which is betwixt God, and mans ſoule, when, as <hi>S. John</hi> ſaith, <hi>God is in the righteous,</hi>

               <p>Which <hi>union</hi> as of all other, and above all things in this world, it is to be moſt deſired, eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and preſerved; ſo is the ſeparation or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce the moſt to be feared, grieved for, and moſt carefully to be prevented; for, as by that bleſſed union we are made partakers of all the beſt things that earth or heaven can afford; ſo by that ſeparation, we not only loſe all the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings by that union acquired, but we purchaſe to our ſelves all the miſcries, vexations, and torments, that hell, the Devils, and our owne conſcience can afflict us with: the cutting off a finger from the hand is painfull; of the hand from the arm painfull, and damagefull; and of the head from the body, painfull, grievous, and deadly: but the dividing or divorcing the ſoule of man from God, the life of the ſoule, is a pain, grief, and loſſe not to be expreſſed, no nor to be imagined fully, no not by them that ſuffer and feel it. Of all ſeparations and divorces, O my ſoule be fearfull and carefull to avoid this: and, O thou the God of my ſoule, be gracious, and mercifull unto me, that through blindneſſe of underſtanding, or hardneſſe of heart, I never incurre the dreadfull ſentence of ſuch a divorce or ſeparation.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And if ever any exceeded in love,<note place="margin">Joh. 10.20.</note> above all the love that ever was in the world, it was Chriſt; who ſo exceeded herein, that the Jews once
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:169899:16"/>thought him mad. And might not others, as well as they, have imagined the like of him, when in the exceſſe of his love to his very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he would ſuffer himſelf to be taken, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up, and ſhamefully put to death for them? Thus far did the love in Chriſt work him to go, or ſeem to be <hi>beſides himſelf:</hi> and all, that he might work us to return to, and to look into our ſelves, and up to heaven; that, as raviſht with the love hereof, we might live here in the world, as though we were out of the world; and that we might ſo look on theſe delights below, as men blinde; and hear of them, as deaf; and diſcourſe of them, as not concerned; but as men in part tranſlated to heaven, and here become <hi>earthly Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> made his daily prayers unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Chriſt, That he would grant unto the Epheſians <hi>the riches of his holy Spirit, to be rooted and grounded in love:</hi>

               <p>For it is able to make things in themſelves baſe and contemptible, to be of great price and eſteem. Might it not ſeem in our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our a blemiſh and diſhonour to his perſon, to be reviled, ſcorned, whipt, and crucified: yet the love of Chriſt took and accounted all as acts of glory; and all, that he might prove himſelf thereby, the <hi>Saviour of the world.</hi> It is regiſtred

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> The Cauſes and Motives of Love.</head>
               <p>I Shall not yet here touch upon the prime and principall cauſe of Love, which is <hi>God:</hi> but of that which is neereſt unto God, <hi>goodneſſe;</hi> which is the true proportionate object of the will, and ſo of our love. Inſomuch, that if the will at any time makes choice of the contrary, which is <hi>evill,</hi> this comes to paſſe by the wills being deceived by a falſe object, and counterfeit colour, in appearance of ſome <hi>ſeeming good.</hi> For the will, in its pure conſtitution, doth not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not affect or deſire that which in it ſelf ſimply is, and ſo appears to be evill.</p>
               <p>A man blinded in his reaſon, and deceived by the pleaſancy of wine, or the beauty of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, may will the unlawfull company of the one, and the inordinate uſe of the other: yet
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:169899:19"/>in neither doth he will or deſire fornication, or drunkenneſſe, as they are evils; but, as he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to be termed a fornicator, or a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard: ſo though he become, or be both, yet he deſires not drunkenneſſe or fornication, but onely the baſe delight and pleaſure in them; which hath deceived and couſened his deſire; under a ſhew of that which ſeemed then unto him good.</p>
               <p>For God, which made all by <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>meaſure,</hi> hath given to our underſtanding and will, certain naturall inclinations, which as laws, cauſe them to affect their proper objects, which are <hi>truth</hi> to the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> and <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> to the <hi>will.</hi> So that who is perverted, or willingly perverteth the truth, this is done by the falſe colour and ſhadow of truth: and ſo it comes to paſſe in the matter of our will, which ever deſires that which is good, and if decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it is by that which appears at that time ſo to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath ranged Love into <hi>three kinds,</hi> according to the three ſeverall objects alluring the will and deſire. The one is, <hi>love of pleaſure</hi> and delight, which too commonly follows, and is entertained by youth. Another is, the <hi>love of wealth,</hi> and is the ſervant moſtly of old age. A third, is the <hi>love of that which is comely and honeſt,</hi> which, I fear, hath the leaſt part or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy in mans will, where private intereſt bears the ſway. We have read, that in ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, vertue, honour, and beauty, had the maſtery in the will; but thoſe objects are laid aſide, and are paſt away with thoſe times.</p>
               <p>Some ancient Fathers give a reaſon why our Saviour openly proclaimed his gift of <hi>paradiſe</hi> to the Thiefe on the Croſſe, rather than to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:169899:19"/>the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Prophets;</hi> and it was, ſay they, becauſe he, at that time when Chriſt was publickly diſeſteemed, and contemptuouſly uſed by all, that he then proclaimed him to be the <hi>Meſſias</hi> and the <hi>Saviour of the world.</hi> This ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular bounty therefore of our Saviour, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied that rare piece of faith and love in the Thief, to whom (at that time when the Thief profeſt him) <hi>Chriſt</hi> had ſhewed no miracle, nor done him ſavour. Whereas now adaies few ſerve or worſhip Chriſt, unleſs he honour or ſerve their turns: ſo that were it not for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits he daily beſtows on us, he might for us, live as retired in the contemplation of his own infinite goodneſſe, with little or no love of the world.</p>
               <p>Next to <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> not onely Philoſophers, but the holy Scriptures, have aſſigned <hi>knowledge</hi> to be an eſpeciall worker of love. Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>This is life eternall,</hi>

                  <hi>to know the Father and the Son;</hi> for from this knowledge ariſeth our love, and by them both, we attain to life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. Unbelief, ignorance, or the forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this principle, as to ſay with the foole, <hi>there is no God,</hi> or with the Epicure, he regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not our works below, but that we may, for all him, eat and drink, and die. Theſe, and ſuch like, are the great cauſes of all our ſinnes. S. <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſedly hath expreſt ſo much, when he ſaith, <hi>The Gentiles have given themſelves over unto all laſciviouſneſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.19.</note> 
                  <hi>to worke all uncleanneſſe with greedineſſe.</hi> Whereof the cauſe is expreſt in the verſe before; when he ſaith, this they did, <hi>having their underſtandings darkened, through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their hearts.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſaith, <hi>there is no knowledge of God in the land:</hi>

                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:169899:20"/>and what then follows? but ver 2. <hi>ſwearing, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, killing, ſtealing, adultery,</hi> ſo that <hi>blood tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I may adde another cauſe, or the ingenderer of love, which is <hi>likeneſs. Like will to like,</hi> is ſeen among the beaſts, among whom ſheep flock not with woolves, nor will Harts heard with Lions.</p>
               <p>And the like to this in man, ſome Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have attributed it to the <hi>complexion</hi> in men; among whom we finde the company, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, voice, and looks of ſome, to be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and diſtaſtfull to others; for which the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon diſaffecting, at firſt happily, can give no ſufficient reaſon.</p>
               <p>Others, and more neerly to reaſon and truth, have given the cauſe of this love betwixt men, to be the <hi>likeneſſe</hi> of their <hi>qualities</hi> and <hi>diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> as the ſinner hateth the righteous, whatever the alliance is, as it was ſeen in <hi>Cain</hi> to <hi>Abel, Iſmael</hi> to <hi>Iſaac, Eſau</hi> to <hi>Jacob:</hi> ſo on the other ſide, the good, juſt, and wiſe, love each other. S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath determined this piece, when he ſaith, <hi>Be ye not unequally yoaked; for what fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip hath righteouſneſſe with unrighteouſneſſe?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.14.</note> 
                  <hi>and what communion hath light with darkneſſe? and what concord hath Chriſt with Belial?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Pythagorean</hi> and <hi>Platonique</hi> Philoſophers were of opinion, that the ſoules of men had a kinde of <hi>harmonious concent</hi> each to other; ſo that, as in <hi>muſick,</hi> one ſtring being ſtruck, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will quaver, and offer to give the like ſound, though not touched: ſo ſay they, and not improbably, fareth it with the ſouls of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> giveth another <hi>cauſe</hi> or parent of love, which is <hi>converſation;</hi> when as he tells us,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169899:20"/>that to this end <hi>God walked</hi> with man in <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,</hi> and that it is ſaid of <hi>Enoch,</hi> that he <hi>walked with God;</hi> and though God had given <hi>Adam</hi> all the goods of the aire, earth, and water, yet with none of theſe, or any, or all of the Beaſts took he any delight, but onely in that <hi>conſort</hi> which God gave him, as a companion to his body, and ſolace to his ſoule, and to her he cleaves, and ſo of two, they are made but one, by a loving converſe and agreement.</p>
               <p>If any aske, how this comes to paſſe, that <hi>likeneſſe</hi> and <hi>converſation</hi> ſhould thus beget, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and increaſe love: the reaſon is eaſie and plain: for ſeeing every man naturally loves himſelf, and the rather becauſe he is ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with himſelf; therefore it muſt needs follow, that whatever is neereſt to, or moſt like him, that he moſt neerly loveth, and moſt deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. Can any give any other reaſon, why man or woman delights to ſee their face in a <hi>glaſſe,</hi> but becauſe it repreſents them, and makes them, as it were, to ſee and know themſelves by this repreſentative, whereby the imagination appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends it ſelf?</p>

               <p>THe <hi>eſſence</hi> or <hi>being</hi> of God is pure and ſimple, and the infinity of his <hi>attributes</hi> and perfections are ſingle: ſo that his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency is his mercy, his mercy is his juſtice, his juſtice his goodneſſe, his goodneſſe his love, neither is there in theſe any diſtinction <hi>reall</hi> or <hi>formall,</hi> onely mans apprehenſion conceiteth a variety in this ſimple unity.</p>
               <p>Now the love of God differeth from the love of man, as in many other things, ſo in this, that mans love oft times wants power to effect what it loves and deſires: whereas Gods love is both <hi>operative</hi> and <hi>effective,</hi> it both works and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſheth
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:169899:23"/>whatever it will; ſo that to love with God, is the ſame thing as to do us good.</p>
               <p>And this is ſo large, as to do that, beyond which nothing more can be done. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth this in Gods perſon, ſaying,<note place="margin">Iſa. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And to ſhew the infinite love of God to man? that Perſon who moſt directly was offended, came down from Heaven, tooke mans nature, and ſuffered more than man could do; and all to redeem man. So that he alone, (God, that can draw good out of evill, and light out of darkneſſe) uſed mans ſin as an occaſion, through his love, to ſave mankinde.</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Zacbary</hi> deſcribes the ſtate of the world,<note place="margin">Zach. 6.</note> and in eſpecially of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> by <hi>foure Chariots;</hi> the firſt whereof had <hi>red horſes,</hi> which typified the bloody <hi>Babylonians:</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond had <hi>black horſes,</hi> which noted the <hi>Perſians;</hi> under whom the <hi>Jews</hi> were neer their utter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation: the third had <hi>white horſes,</hi> by which may be meant the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who, as <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and others, were gracious and favourable to the <hi>Jews:</hi> the fourth had <hi>grizled,</hi> or horſes of divers colours, which figured the changeable, various, and mixed government of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which firſt or laſt is deſtructive to a State. And
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:169899:24"/>now under this power and rule, which contained all the miſrule and barbarous uſage of the three other Governments, came the <hi>Meſſias</hi> into the world, and this by the Apoſtle is called the <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of time:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note> becauſe when the ſin of the world was at the full, now was .the time of our bleſſed Saviour to come into the world, and by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable love to redeem it.</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſets forth <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> thus: <hi>Their hands are defiled with blood, and their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers with iniquity,</hi>

                  <hi>their lips have ſpoken lies, and their tongues perverſeneſſe; none calleth for juſtice, nor any pleadeth for truth: the act of violence is in their hands, their feet run to evill, and they make baſte to ſhed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, waſting and deſtruction are in their paths. The way of peace they know not; yea, judgement is turned backward, and juſtice ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth afar off: for truth is fallen in the ſtreets, and equity cannot enter: and he that departeth from evill, maketh himſelf a prey. And the Lord ſaw, and wondered that there was no Interceſſor; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his arm brought ſalvation. For he put on righteouſneſſe as a breaſt-plate, and vengeance for a clothing; and according to their deeds, he will repay fury to his adverſaries: but to Zion ſhall the Redeemer come.</hi> And is there any thing in all this, that ſavours, but of the love of God (to truth and juſtice) to his people, though laden with their ſins; and for this puniſhed and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by their enemies?</p>
               <p>The love of Chriſt in this kinde, is not to be uttered, or any way expreſſed. I will ſumme it up therefore in that one paſſage of S. <hi>Paul;</hi> the ſame night that our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> was betrayed, he inſtituted the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of his <hi>body broken,</hi>

               <p>Yea, God is jealous of the inordinate or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much love of the <hi>husband</hi> to the <hi>wife,</hi> or of the <hi>wife</hi> to the <hi>husband.</hi> For theſe may love each other ſo much, that ſome part of the love and worſhip due to God, is beſtowed on the <hi>Creature.</hi> And for this God oft times turns jealous, and in his anger takes the one from the other; or bereaves them of their delight, which is chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>And it being ſo, that God hath commanded us to love him <hi>with all our heart,</hi> and with all
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:169899:26"/>the <hi>ſtrength</hi> and powers of the ſoule, the leaſt alienation of our love from God, and beſtowed on vain delights, moves God to jealouſie, and provokes his anger.</p>
               <p>And as the leaſt withdrawing of our love from God, works jealouſie in him: ſo when he finds us perſiſt in a daily revolt from him, he ceaſeth any longer to be jealous. See this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in <hi>Iſraels</hi> caſe; where God, for <hi>Iſraels</hi> mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied departings from him, threatens, <hi>My jealouſie ſhall depart from them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 16.42.</note> 
                  <hi>and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.</hi> And this is the ſaddeſt condition that a ſoule can fall into; for then it is apparent, that God hath ſent a <hi>bill of divorce</hi> to that ſoul: and hath removed his love utterly from it; for where God loves, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be jealous.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> God ſeemeth to be ſolitary without man, which is an eſpeciall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his love to man.</head>
               <p>THe Scriptures tell us of thouſands of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that attend Chriſt; and in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels we finde them upon all occaſions, at his birth, in his life, and at his paſſion with him: how then, having ſuch a company of holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ever with him, and at his command, can he be ſaid to be alone (if without man?) It is true, in reſpect of the ſweet ſociety of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, he cannot be truly ſaid to be alone; yet in regard that he made man to his own Image, and every one loves that which is moſt like unto himſelf: and that God hath ſaid, <hi>My delight is to be with the Sons of men;</hi> in this reſpect, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this his like, with whom he is delighted, he may well be ſaid to be alone.</p>
               <p>In the parable of the <hi>loſt ſheep,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 18.12.</note> it is ſeen, that the ſhepherd had 99. beſides that which was ſtrayed, yet he left them all. Suppoſe theſe to be the Saints and Angels in heaven, and all to ſeek the one that was loſt, which is man. The Prophet ſaith, <note place="margin">Pſal. 33.10.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord looked down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to behold the Sons of men;</hi> and ſeeing them captiv'd by the Devill, weltring in their filth of ſin, and therefore lamentably afflicted; for them he came down, and never reſted, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent all travell, hardneſſe, and death; that he might exalt them, and bring them where him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was to have his everlaſting reſidence, in Heaven.</p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:169899:27"/>
               <p>God under the Law, when he ſaw his <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſcattered in <hi>Egypt,</hi> he reſted not, till he brought them together; and though in the wilderneſſe, yet there he commanded them to make a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and after that, a large and glorious Temple; that he might be with them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, as it were, their company there together.</p>
               <p>And Chriſt, God in heaven, that he might have the company of man, he deſcended from heaven; and as though this were too little, to have the more full ſociety of man, he took his nature, and was made man; yea ſo, that as it was ſpoken of <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Eve,</hi> he was ſo married to mans nature, that he might truly ſay, <hi>He is bone of my bone, and fleſh of my fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>More yet; ſee Chriſt in his agony and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> and wanting the company of his Diſciples, and men believing in him, he cries out, <hi>My God! my God!</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 27.46.</note> 
                  <hi>why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me?</hi> and as ſoon as the the Thief on the one hand was converted, and prayed unto him, <hi>Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 23.43.</note> 
                  <hi>remember me when thou comeſt into thy Kingdome;</hi> he was ſo pleaſed with this, that he readily granted his petition, and told him, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe:</hi> and ſo gently departed, and took his new convert with him to Heaven.</p>
               <p>And it is the opinion of many ancient and learned Fathers, that the Saints and holy men which roſe out of their graves, at the time of our Saviours reſurrection; that they likewiſe, as pleaſing company, aſcended with Chriſt into Heaven, there to be with him; and as of the <hi>Chore,</hi> to ſing continuall Allelujahs of glory, <hi>Glory to the Lamb, that was, and is, and ever ſhall be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>S. <hi>Hierome</hi> cries out, O ungrateful man to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:169899:28"/>thy God, who ever thou art! conſidereſt thou not the wonderful and unſpeakable love of him, the Lord of heaven, to be thus delighted, and to do, and to ſuffer ſo much for thee? and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thou thy ſelf beſt, when thou art in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the wicked, blaſphemers, murderers, adulterers, drunkards, and profane perſons? <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> rather, <hi>Shunamite, return,</hi> and run to him who is delighted with thee, and is thy Saviour.</p>

               <p>When <hi>David</hi> had wickedly deflowred the wife of his faithfull Souldier <hi>Vriah,</hi> and baſely ſlaughtered the husband; here were ſins of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, adultery, ſcandall, and all theſe ſins, and enmities againſt his <hi>neighbour:</hi> but as though theſe were nothing in compariſon of that one ſin and enmity to God; <note place="margin">Pſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But although againſt this ſin principally, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity oppoſeth her forces; yet no leſſe doth ſhe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:169899:28"/>abhor and reſiſt all other ſins of the lower rank. S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>Charity ſuffereth long;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.4.</note> what ſaith he leſſe than that, as the impatient man acts againſt the long ſuffering Charity: ſo Charity works againſt all impatience: and as <hi>Charity,</hi> that <hi>envieth not,</hi> is aſſaulted by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious: ſo Charity fighteth againſt envy: and as Charity, that <hi>vaunteth not,</hi> nor is <hi>puffed up,</hi> is oppoſed by pride: ſo Charity labours to beat down pride. And what from S. <hi>Paul</hi> I have ſaid of thoſe ſins mentioned, is alike true of thoſe other ſins inſtanced by S. <hi>Paul;</hi> and of all other ſins committed in the world. And therefore not onely the Apoſtles, but their and our Lord and Maſter, Chriſt, hath taught us this leſſon, that <hi>Charity is the fulfilling of the Law.</hi> Inſomuch as, <note place="margin">Rom. 13.10.</note> ſo far as Charity can prevail to the killing of ſin, <note place="margin">Mat. 22.40.</note> which is the tranſgreſſion of the Law, ſhe may well be called the fulfilling of the Law.</p>
               <p>And ſo high an eſteem had our Lord Chriſt, of the great virtue and power which Charity hath in the work of our ſalvation. that when he had largely preached of the whole duty of man, and given him many precepts, and expoſitions of the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> neceſſary to be underſtood and followed by old and young, learned and illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: for the relief of mans memory, and the greater incouragement to his proceeding, he ſummes up all, and tells us all the Law, and all that God requires of man, is nothing elſe but Charity; (that is) <hi>love to God,</hi> and for his ſake, <hi>love to thy neighbour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> addeth, that as God calls himſelf Love, who is all in all: <note place="margin">1 John 4.8.</note> for <hi>all things are from him, by him, and for him:</hi> ſo the like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a quail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and reverend ſenſe, we may ſpeak of Love or Charity; we ſay, he that hath not houſes,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:169899:29"/>nor Vineyards, nor Lands, yet if he hath <hi>Money,</hi> he hath potentially all: ſo may we ſay of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in reſpect of other graces and endowments of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>In the place before cited, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks that of himſelf, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.1.</note> which the beſt of men may ſay of themſelves with the like truth; that could I preach as though I ſpoke with the <hi>tongue of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:</hi> yet this without <hi>Charity,</hi> will make me but like an empty ſound of braſſe, or like the bell in the ſleeple, that calls others to the Church, and ſo to Heaven, while it ſelf hangs without doors. Nay, do I <hi>give all my goods to the poore, and my body</hi> to martyrdome for the truth, and have no <hi>charity,</hi> theſe will <hi>profit me nothing.</hi> Yea, if I <hi>underſtand all the myſteries</hi> of God, and have <hi>all faith,</hi> ſaith he, and <hi>have not Charity;</hi> obſerve this, he ſaith not of this laſt, as of the former gifts of preaching, martyrdome, or goods, that theſe without Charity <hi>profit nothing;</hi> but he ſaith, that although he hath <hi>all underſtanding, all knowledge,</hi> and <hi>all ſaith,</hi> yet theſe without <hi>Charity,</hi> make him not onely as a <hi>ſound,</hi> or which <hi>profiteth nothing;</hi> but he ſaith, that having theſe, and not having Charity, <hi>he is plainly nothing;</hi> nothing as in Gods acceptance, and nothing as appertaining to the Kingdome of Heaven.</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> tells the people, that God regards not, <note place="margin">Iſa. 1.</note> but <hi>abhors the ſacrifices</hi> which he requires of them; and that when they <hi>lift up their hands</hi> to Heaven, he will hide his eyes, and not ſee them: and when they make many long and loud <hi>prayers</hi> unto him, yet he will not hear them. And how? or why is God become ſo averſe to his own commands and ordinances? the Prophet tells us, the cauſe is want of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, when he ſaith, <hi>Your hands are full of blood,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:169899:29"/>your works are full of evill, injuſtice, and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> In a word, I ſee not, I hear not, ſaith God, but I abhor you, and your works, becauſe both want Charity.</p>
               <p>Much like this hath the ſame Prophet, <note place="margin">Iſa. 58.</note> taxing the falſhood of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who hypocritically cried out, ſaying, <hi>Have we not held our Faſts? and have we not afflicted our ſouls? yet thou, O Lord, ſeeſt not,</hi> neither takeſt thou knowledge of our holy acts. To whom the Lord in truth makes anſwer, Tis true, I neither ſee, nor take knowledge, nor pleaſure in your ſounds and ſhews of holineſſe. For in, or by theſe, ſaith God, ye exact your labours, or things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ye grieve others. And ye <hi>faſt for ſtrife and debate, and to ſmite with the fiſt of wickedneſſe, and call ye this your faſting,</hi> ſaith God? no, ſaith he, <hi>the faſt that I have choſen, is to looſe the bands of wickedneſſe, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppreſſed go free, and that ye break every yoak</hi> (of Taxes, Excize, and the like) theſe, theſe, and not praying, preaching, faſting, with murder, robbery, and oppreſſion, are the works of Charity, well pleaſing to, and required of God.

                  <note place="margin">Deut. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>with all thy ſoul, and with all thy might.</hi> In which words, not onely the precept is expreſt to love him: but the reaſon is annexed, becauſe he is the Lord of all, and thy God in ſpeciall. And that thou mayeſt keep this commandment, it ſhall be in thy heart. And becauſe <hi>from the abundance of the heart, the mouth ſpeaketh;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou ſhalt talk of it ſitting, walking, lying, riſing, that thy children thereby may learne the ſame: and thou ſhalt <hi>binde it on thine hand, and between thine eyes; and ſhalt write it upon the poſts of thine houſe, and on thy gates.</hi> I do not remember that any law or precept was ſo largely and ſtrongly injoyned as this, binding heart, tongue, eyes, and all the faculties of the ſoul, to love God.</p>
               <p>Probably ſome may demand, wherefore the Almighty ſhould ſo earneſtly and deſirouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire our love before, or more then any, or all things elſe, that are in mans power? In <hi>anſwer</hi> whereunto, I may ſay, that man hath nothing elſe to preſent, that is ſo much his own, or that is ſo much worthy of Gods acceptance, nor ſo eaſie and beneficiall to himſelf (for man) to give, as his <hi>love.</hi> And therefore that which is leaſt painfull, or chargeable, and moſt eaſie and beneficiall to the <hi>giver,</hi> man: and which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, is moſt pleaſing to the <hi>Receiver,</hi> God: God the <hi>Receiver,</hi> in his infinite goodneſſe, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of man, the <hi>giver,</hi> onely his love.</p>
               <p>If a man were in danger to loſe his life, or his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:169899:30"/>underſtanding, or but an eye, or any other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his body, how would he love that perſon, who could and would cure, free, or deliver him? and how much more then is he bound to love him, who both gave the eye, the other members, reaſon, and life; and not only made them won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully, but gave them freely, with all manner of gracious endowments; and not onely ſo made, and ſo gave them, but who hourly ſo <hi>preſerveth</hi> them from all outward and inward dangers of corruption and deſtruction? can any price or eſtimate be ſet, ſufficient for ſuch a rare work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, ſo bounteous a gift, and ſo gracious a preſervation? and then can we render any thing leſſe for them all, than love to him, that ſo made, ſo gave, and ſo preſerves them all?</p>
               <p>And yet hitherto I have told you but the leaſt of what God hath done for the <hi>meaneſt part</hi> of thy ſelf. For when I ſhall adde, that when thou hadſt deſtroyed thy <hi>ſoule</hi> by ſin, and forfeited it with thy <hi>body,</hi> and all the faculties and members of both, to the Devill and everlaſting hell fire; that then thy God ſhould deſcend from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſhould be diſgracefully uſed, ſhamefully tortured, and cruelly murdered; and all this only to ranſome and free both thy <hi>body</hi> and <hi>ſoul:</hi> Can any price be ſet too high for this? or canſt thou repay any thing leſſe then thy <hi>love?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Should God, as he might juſtly, for the leaſt of his mercies and benefits, have commanded thee to offer unto him all thy worldly wealth, or to ſacrifice thy children to him, as ſome Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens did, and as once he tempted <hi>Abraham</hi> to do: or with ſtripes or faſting to mortifie or kill thy body; had it been too much for a compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or requitall? but, in lieu of theſe, what a mercy, what a goodneſſe, what a love is it in thy
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169899:31"/>God, to require onely that which coſts thee leaſt, which is eaſieſt performed, and is in the power of all ſorts of people to give, <hi>love?</hi> which if thou keepeſt back, and cheerfully rendereſt not, how canſt thou anſwer thine owne ſoule without bluſhing here, or without confuſion and condemnation of thy ſelf at the laſt day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>If God had required of man, almoſt any thing elſe but <hi>love,</hi> ſome or other might have fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, at leaſt, ſome probable ſeeming excuſe for not performance; as if God had commanded our <hi>bounty</hi> to Gods poor, the poor man might have anſwered, I have it not to give; if <hi>faſting,</hi> or <hi>labour,</hi> the ſick and infirm; if <hi>knowledge</hi> or <hi>contemplation;</hi> the ignorant or ſimple might have pleaded, theſe are not in our power to do; and therefore, Lord, I am to be excuſed. But when God requires onely thy love; neither the illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, nor ignorant, neither the poore, nor the weak, nor any other condition or ſort of people, have any ſhew or colour of excuſe for not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; for it is in every mans power, if he will, to love.</p>
               <p>I may adde, that this ſweet return of our <hi>love,</hi> as it is generally eaſie for all men to give: ſo is it as generally alwaies to be performed, in all the actions, ſtudies, or demeanours of our life. Art thou eating, drinking, recreating thy ſelf, buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſelling, meditating? loving of God hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders thee not, but furthers thee in all theſe, ſo in, and with all theſe, he hath but juſtly and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly commanded thy love.</p>
               <p>God by his Prophet thus reaſons with his <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:169899:31"/>ſerve with thy ſins, and thou haſt wearied me with thine iniquities.</hi> And for all this, I ask but that, which without expence, pain, or labour, thou mayeſt eaſily afford me, <hi>thy love;</hi> and for it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive heaven. So eaſie and plain a way, and ſo open a door to everlaſting joy, hath God prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for us, when he requires from us onely our love.</p>
               <p>The Scripture is plentifull, not onely in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thee, O man, that God came downe from Heaven, and was incarnate for thee; but that he ſuffered, died, and roſe again, and all this for thee: and it is as often repeated in holy Writ, that he is thy <hi>Lord,</hi> thy <hi>Father,</hi> thy <hi>King,</hi> thy <hi>God;</hi> and if God in all be thine,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 22, 23.</note> the Apoſtle rightly infers, then all that is Gods, Angels, Spirits, and all that is in God, power, juſtice, mercy, all is thine. And canſt thou poſſibly think, how to make a better purchaſe, then to make God, Heaven, Earth, and all thine wholly and onely by Love?</p>
               <p>And when God is thus made thine, then in loving him, thou doſt but love thine own; and this is ſo common, that it is naturall for a man to love what is his, rather then what is another mans. But further, indeed to love God, who by love is made thine, is but to love thy ſelf; who by love art united to God; and no man, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>hates,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.29.</note> but rather <hi>cheriſheth</hi> and loveth himſelf.</p>

               <p>But O man, conſider how reaſonable and juſt God is, in requiring thy whole ſoule: and how unjuſt and unreaſonable thou art in denying it him entire, or dividing it in parts, betwixt him and his enemies. Conſider, I ſay, when he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the goodly univerſe of this world, and ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly adorned and furniſhed it, not onely with the fruitfull plants, and fragrant flowers, but with thoſe bright Lamps in Heaven; that he made all this, and gave it entire to thee alone, making thee the ſole Lord thereof, in reſpect of any other creatures, over all which alſo he gave thee temporall power and dominion: and as though in this he had ſhewed but half, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but the leaſt part of his love: conſider, that God himſelf gave himſelf wholly to thee, was incarnate, ſuffered, died, roſe, and all onely for thee, and not for any other. And is not this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſufficient, that the leaſt thou canſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in gratitude, ſhould be thy heart, entire, not to be cut into parcels or ſhreds; ſome whereof to be given to the giver of all, and the reſt to his and thine own enemies?</p>
               <p>But ſome perchance may ſay, though this is juſt and reaſonable, which is required, yet it is moſt difficult, for man clothed with fleſh, to performe this duty ſo ſtrictly commanded, to love God with all the affections and thoughts of the ſoul, and theſe ever to be fixed on him, and nothing elſe; neither on parents, friends, or things of this life.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:169899:33"/>
               <p>In anſwer hereunto I muſt tell you, that God knoweth what we are, and whereof we are made; and therefore in this ſtrict command, or abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute requeſt of all our love, he prohibits us nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to love parents, children, friends, no nor the things of this world: ſo we love them with theſe <hi>two rules</hi> or cautions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we love neither friends, nor things on earth, with ſuch a degree of affection as may alienate or divide our fouls from God. And therefore God himſelf hath not onely comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us to love our neighbours, all our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, of what rank or diſtance ſoever, ſo they be men: and to ſeek in the ſecond place, things neceſſary for the life and well being of our ſelves and thoſe who depend on us, and for whom we are to provide: but hath figured the fame in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioning our heart; which though it hath a large and broad <hi>ſuperficies</hi> upward, to look and dilate it ſelf to Heaven: yet it hath but a <hi>cone</hi> or ſmall point downwards, to the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath.</p>
               <p>The ſecond caution, in our love to any thing beſides God, is, that whatever we thus love, it muſt virtually tend and move to the ſervice and glory of God. And in this, our love reſembles the point of the <hi>needle</hi> in the Sea-mans Card, or the Geometricians paire of <hi>compaſſes;</hi> the former of which, though it be ever moving, and as it were, caſting about to ſeverall parts, yet it ſtill returns, and reteins its whole ſetled courſe to the true pole ſtar: and the latter, though the one foot of the Compaſſe circuit and ſurround the <hi>circumference</hi> or globe of the earth, yet the other ſtands ever firm and conſtant to the point, which point here, as that ſtar before, in this our application, is God.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:169899:34"/>
               <p>So that God, who without any ſhew of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe in himſelf, or wrong to thee, might require all thy ſubſtance, all thy actions, and all thy time, wholly to be dedicated and ſpent on his immediate holy ſervice: yet grants rhee the fruits of thy honeſt labour, thy wealth, and bids thee give his poore, onely th t which thou mayeſt well ſpare; and of the fruits of thy increaſe, he takes onely a <hi>tenth;</hi> and from thy worldly travails, onely a <hi>ſeventh</hi> part: and that Love which he wholly and entirely calls for, is the affection and love of thy heart.</p>
               <p>Shall I ſumme up all? There is none ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly in this world, but aſſents to this generall doctrine, that God is to be ſo loved as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; but all the queſtion and difference lies in the performance, and manner of loving; for the moſt wicked, in ſome ſort, may be ſaid to love God. But how? and why? for it is but with a <hi>carnall</hi> or <hi>worldly</hi> minde, and to their own end and behoof; as by him to enjoy life, health, wealth, pleaſure, and delight; and ſo they love God for theſe things, that if he would confirm his <hi>letters patents</hi> unto them, that theſe they might perpetually enjoy, they would readily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe unto him all the grant and intereſt made to them in Heaven.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the true lovers of God ſo love the world, as that thereby, and therewith, they may the better ſerve him, and promote his glory; without which, they deſire neither the things of the world, nor long to continue in it. They love theſe things ſo, as a man doth his horſe, his cloak, or garment; the one to carry him through his journey, to his Inne, and the other to keep him warm, and to defend him from the hurt or violence of the weather: ſo
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:169899:34"/>that the love of the firſt, is like that of the Strumpets, all for <hi>reward,</hi> or <hi>what will ye give me?</hi> and by theſe means, he makes the <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall</hi> of what he ſhould love, God, but the <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory</hi> to the thing he loves: and the <hi>acceſſory</hi> indeed, the things of the world, and fleſh, he makes the <hi>principall</hi> part of his love. Whereas the true lover makes God the <hi>prime, originall, principall cauſe,</hi> and mover of all his love, and all things elſe, but <hi>ſubordinate</hi> and <hi>ſubſervient</hi> to this love.</p>
               <p>The <hi>regenerate</hi> and <hi>unregenerate</hi> children of God in this world, make uſe of Gods bleſſings; and ſo return their love to God, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> bleſſed his two ſons, <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau:</hi> where the father in bleſſing <hi>Jacob,</hi> ver. 28. begins with heaven;<note place="margin">Gen. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>God give thee of the dew of heaven,</hi> yet he after adds the <hi>fatneſſe of the earth:</hi> but in bleſſing <hi>Eſau,</hi> ver. 39. he begins with the earth, <hi>Behold, thy dwelling ſhall be of the fatneſſe of the earth, and of the dew above.</hi> In like manner God gives his truly beloved <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the <hi>dew,</hi> the deſire, and love of heaven in the firſt place: but to the Edomite, firſt the <hi>fatneſſe of the earth;</hi> and according as their deſires are ſet, ſo alſo are their loves; this mans to the world, and the others to God. And by theſe their loves, as by certain and infallible rules, ye may know and diſcerne what they are.</p>

               <p>IN this Chapter of Angels, my Authour is very large, and attributes mare unto Angels, then I can finde ſufficient ground for; therefore I ſhall abbreviate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and deliver no more from him, then I conceive is warrantable. Which is,</p>
               <p>In Scripture we have no mention of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, untill the world was above nineteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years old;<note place="margin">Gen. 16.7.</note> and who that Angell was, that appeared and talked with <hi>Hagar,</hi> is queſtioned By the learned; among which, many are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that it was God himſelf, for that he ſaid, ver. 10. <hi>I will multiply thy ſeed;</hi> and that ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, v. 13. and called the name of the Lord that ſpake unto her, <hi>Thou God ſeeſt me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if this were not God, but a created An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, the queſtion may be, wherefore <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo faithfully and fully ſpeaking of Gods works in that great <hi>Creation,</hi> neither then, nor in all the time ſince, till this of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> hath any word of an Angell. Some are of opinion, that <hi>Moſes</hi> writing more eſpecially to his Countrymen the <hi>Jews,</hi> omitted the hiſtory of the Angels creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, leſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> over apt (as the moſt ſimple people are) to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> might by it have fallen into ſuch an eſteem of them, as to have adored them. Or, <hi>Moſes</hi> writing his hiſtory of the <hi>Creation</hi> in brief, expreſt onely what more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly concerned man to know concerning his duty and ſervice to God; yet when he finds a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:169899:35"/>juſt and neceſſary cauſe, he then omits not to ſpeak of them, as in this ſtory of <hi>Hagar.</hi>

               <p>Now what they are, though we have not in Scripture any exact diſcourſe or definition of their natures, yet the Pſalmiſt hath expreſt the end and office why they are created, when he ſaith, <hi>God ſhall give his Angels charge over thee,</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> Of the love which man oweth to his neighbour.</head>
               <p>WHen the Phariſee demanded of our Saviour Chriſt which was the <hi>great commandement</hi> in the law, Jeſus ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 22.36.</note> &amp;c. <hi>This is the firſt and great comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: and the ſecond is like unto it, Thou s;halt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf: on theſe two commandments depend the whole Law and the Prophets:</hi> whence it appeareth that the love of our <hi>Neighbour</hi> is next unto and a <hi>declaration</hi> of that former of our love to <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that it is ſo farre neceſſary, that when the Phariſee only asked which was the <hi>great commandement,</hi> Chriſt not only anſwered him directly to that, but thought it requiſite to adde
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:169899:37"/>what the hypocriticall Phariſee leaſt cared for to know, or practiſe, namely what God had commanded touching his <hi>neighbour:</hi> yea and S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> addes, that in ſome reſpects prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers have more cauſe to inforce this doctrine of <hi>love to our neighbour,</hi> then that of our <hi>love to God,</hi> for that all things which we ſee, feel, have and enjoy, prompt and move us to this, whereas there are many and ſeverall occaſions daily offered through our words, bargains, tranſactions, and private intereſt, to divert or leſſen our love to our <hi>neighbour,</hi> and therefore I ſhall ſet you down ſome reaſons moving to, and confirming the neceſſity of this <hi>duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the firſt ſhall be, that our Saviour Chriſt gave us this <hi>commandement,</hi> which indeed is in the nature of an ineſtimable legacy, even then when he was to depart this life, and to leave the world; and we uſually ſay, and hold it true, that the charge or gift of a dying friend ſticks and works moſt in the heart of the friend living, and therefore Chriſt at the laſt point as it were before his paſſion ſpeaks unto his diſciples, and in them unto us, ſaying, My time is ſhort, and I finde death approaching,<note place="margin">Joh. 13.34<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> before which, I have one eſpeciall remembrance to give you, that you love one another, and that in no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way, or according to the courſe of this world, but ſo to love one another even as I have loved you, who converſed with you kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, communicated all to you friendly, and have truly laid down my life for you; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my laſt Will and Legacy to you is, that <hi>as I have loved you that even ſo yee love one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to ſtrengthen, yea to ſweeten this gift of command, Chriſt in the words following gives a good reaſon; for, ſaith he, by this kind
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:169899:37"/>of love among you, as by a cognizance or badge <hi>all men ſhall know that yee are my diſciples:</hi> and I this will prove if not in the eyes and eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world, yet I am ſure in the hearts of all good men, in the eſteem of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and in the eyes of my heavenly Father, a peece of great honour unto you to be know through your mutuall love to be <hi>my diſciples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The brethren of <hi>Joſeph</hi> fearing that he might call to minde and revenge the injuries done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by his brethren,<note place="margin">Gen. 50.16.</note> they ſent a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger unto <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who ſaid unto him, <hi>Thy Father did command before he dyed; forgive I pray thee now the treſpaſſe of thy brethren and their ſinne:</hi> which words of his dying Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when <hi>Joſeph</hi> heard, he <hi>wept</hi> faith the text, and ſpake kindly unto them, and not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt his love by words and tears, but he <hi>comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> and <hi>nouriſhed them and their little ones:</hi> and the like love with <hi>Joſeph,</hi> if we have any <hi>bowels</hi> toward ſo dear a friend, our Lord and Maſter, as Chriſt was, we will ſhew for his ſake, who dying commanded us <hi>ſo to love one another, as he loved us who gave his life for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet leſt as Chriſt foreſaw and foretold that in the laſt days, as <hi>iniquity ſhould increaſe,</hi> ſo <hi>charity would wax cold,</hi> and thereby both our love to ſuch a dead friend, and for his ſake to our <hi>neighbour</hi> would grow faint and dye, he therefore gives us a ſecond reaſon to love our neighbours, which with man may happily work more then the former, becauſe it contains in it the unſpeakable benefit and reward acquired by this love to our neighbour, and this benefit is no leſſe then the <hi>kingdome of heaven,</hi> with the full fruition of all the unutterable and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable joyes with Chriſt for ever. All which
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:169899:38"/>are evidently and expreſly promiſed and annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this love; for when God in the <hi>Law</hi> and our Saviour in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> have pronounced <hi>life</hi> and the <hi>kingdome of heaven</hi> to thoſe that keep and fulfill the law, and their commands, the Apoſtle as the <hi>Embaſſadour</hi> of God hath plainly pronounced and proclaimed that <hi>love is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of all this law;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13.10.</note> &amp; indeed our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſpake no leſſe (and from it this our Apoſtle might take his Commiſſion) when he ſaid,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.40.</note> 
                  <hi>on love depends all the Law and the Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither doeth the reward of our love to our <hi>neighbour</hi> terminate and end in this great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing declared, but it works before it comes to that, and produceth ſingular and infinite bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, therefore our Saviour before he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the keeping of this <hi>commandement of love</hi> to his diſciples,<note place="margin">Joh. 14.14.</note> he prefaceth, <hi>what ever yee ſhall aske of God in my name that will I doe:</hi> then in the next words he ſubjoyneth, as the means to obtain this wonderfull grant and bleſſing, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">v. 15.</note> this is to be performed <hi>if yee love me and keep my commandements,</hi> that is, <hi>to love one another.</hi> And yet as though this were not the halfe of that bleſſed reward which Chriſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexeth to this love, he goes on ſaying, it you love,<note place="margin">v. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>I will give you the Comforter who may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with you forever, even the ſpirit of truth,</hi> intimating hereby, and that plainly, that as by love we receive the <hi>comfort</hi> of the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> ſo without it, neither <hi>truth</hi> nor <hi>comfort</hi> will or can dwell or abide with us.</p>
               <p>And which is a third reaſon to incite and ſtirre us to this love, <hi>nature</hi> it ſelfe infuſeth this love into the heart of man, which in this ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſeth with the <hi>ſenſitive creatures,</hi> that all ſo love and agree together according to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:169899:38"/>kindes, that they not only fall not out among themſelves to hurt each other, but feed, nouriſh, flock and herd together, helping and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding each other againſt the aſſaults and hurts of other enemies to their kind.</p>
               <p>And this reaſon of love drawn from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſon is and ought much to be ſtrengthned by that bond of <hi>naturall propagation,</hi> for that what God vouchſafed not to other creatures, no nor to his good <hi>Angels,</hi> he granted unto <hi>man</hi> as an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall bounty and ſign of his love, that all mankind ſhould proceed from one <hi>generall Father, Adam,</hi> that ſo all his poſterity as deſcending from one and the ſame root, might all love, as being in or indeed as all but one.</p>
               <p>I read that when <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperor had ſent to <hi>Pliny</hi> Praetor in Sicily to deſtroy all the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> there, the Praetor forbore the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and counſelled the Emperor rather to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh then extirpate them, for ſaith he they are a people, which live in obedience to law, they neither rob, nor kill, nor injure any, but live as hating none, but loving all.</p>
               <p>And when I read that of S. <hi>Paul, love is the fulfilling of the law,</hi> I finde that the Apoſtle in the ſame text by way of command bids to <hi>owe no man any thing,</hi> but mutuall love;<note place="margin">Rom. 13.18.</note> whence I conclude that love as it is a command from God, ſo from and by God it is held as a <hi>debt,</hi> and ſo injoyned, as that though we daily pay it, yet we ſhould never be diſcharged from it, but that we ſhould with our days and years grow yearly and daily more in this debt of <hi>mutuall love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there is a fourth reaſon perſwading and urging this love, which is ſtronger then that of <hi>nature,</hi> and this is our <hi>ſpirituall brotherhood,</hi> as
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:169899:39"/>being not ſo much one from our <hi>naturall</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, as one by our <hi>ſpirituall birth</hi> and regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in our <hi>baptiſme,</hi> whereby being united to our <hi>head Chriſt,</hi> we are all become <hi>members</hi> of Chriſts <hi>myſticall body,</hi> and this, if any thing, will inforce our love; It was the argument which good <hi>Abraham</hi> uſed to <hi>Lot,</hi> Let us have no breach nor difference betwixt us, but let us love and live in accord; <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, (and he thought he could bring no ſtronger argument for it then this) <hi>me are brethren.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 13.8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And we Chriſtians may ſay we are all <hi>bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> not by one <hi>Father</hi> in the <hi>fleſh,</hi> but by one Father which is in <hi>heaven,</hi> and by one <hi>Mother</hi> the chaſt undefiled <hi>ſpouſe of Chriſt,</hi> and by theſe we become heires, not of an eſtate got by force or fraud and which may be taken away by fire, theeves, injuſtice or an uſurping power, but of an <hi>inheritance in the heavens,</hi> where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theef nor uſurper ſhall ever come, to help himſelf or hurt us.</p>
               <p>When S. <hi>Paul</hi> had ſhewed how in Chriſt we are all become <hi>one body,</hi>

                     </gap>.</note> he then inferres that no one part can pride it ſelfe over an other, ſaying, <hi>I have no need of thee,</hi> but that as members in the <hi>naturall body,</hi> ſo much more being <hi>members</hi> in this <hi>myſticall body</hi> of Chriſt, we ſhould be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly compaſſionate, and not only not to have <hi>Schiſmes</hi> and breaches, but much more not to hurt or offend, but rather to help and defend each other from wrong and oppreſſion, and ſo farre as the law will permit, to act as <hi>Moſes</hi> did when he ſaw his contreymen to be oppreſſed or wronged.<note place="margin">Exod. 2.13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> uſeth an other <hi>metaphor</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade this love, when he tells us that this <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall brotherhood</hi> is as the cementing ſtones to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:169899:39"/>in an arch, or other building, where as the one ſupports the other, ſo all united bind and keep all faſt and ſafe together: To which well may that of S. <hi>Paul</hi> be applyed, that <hi>love</hi> or <hi>peace</hi> is the <hi>bond of perfection,</hi> and therefore,<note place="margin">Col. 2.14 Eph. 4.3.</note> 
                  <hi>keeps the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace;</hi> In which texts as love is the bond, ligament, or hold-faſt of the Chriſtians <hi>myſticall body:</hi> ſo it is the bond, uniter, and knitter together of all the perfection that man in this world can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto.</p>
               <p>You ſee the great, ſweet and powerfull effects of this ſpirituall love, begotten by our <hi>baptiſme</hi> into Chriſt; which is much cheriſhed, and increaſed by the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of his <hi>body</hi> and <hi>bloud.</hi> It was not only acted by <hi>Caliline,</hi> but long before him, and ſince, (I would I could not ſay the like of Chriſtians) that they ſtrengthned their <hi>leagues,</hi> and <hi>covenants</hi> of holding together, as it were in one, binding each other to defend, and keep them, though they were <hi>covenants with hell</hi> and <hi>death:</hi> yet theſe I ſay, they entred into, and ſtrengthned by drinking the bloud either of themſelves, or others; a <hi>covenant</hi> we have taken, and received, the Sacrament of the bloud not of beaſts, or man, but of God himſelf; that as we are all <hi>members of one body,</hi> which is Chriſt, ſo we will love one another. In the reall and true performance whereof if we fail, S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that we have not only taken that Sacrament <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11 27.</note> but therein we have taken our <hi>own damnation,</hi> becauſe, ſaith he, <hi>we did not diſcern the body and bloud of Chriſt,</hi> but did eate and drink theſe, as of courſe and in ordinary, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that if we kept and performed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and covenant of love, the <hi>ſeal</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:169899:40"/>whereof was the body, and the <hi>red inke</hi> the bloud of Chriſt, that then we ſhould have <hi>life everlaſting in him:</hi> but otherwiſe nothing but infirmities, ſickneſſe and death. And whether we finde not theſe ſad and deadly effects to have fallen upon us for the want or breach of Gods commandements and our <hi>covenant</hi> ſigned and ſealed in the Sacrament of Chriſts body and bloud, judge and ſeriouſly think of it while I proceed to</p>
               <p>The fifth reaſon why man ſhould love his neighbour, which is grounded upon the nature of the Law-giver, God; for generally ſuch as the legiſlator is, ſuch are his <hi>laws.</hi> So that be the law-maker a bloudy man, his laws ſavour of cruelty and bloud: whereas be he of a ſweet meek diſpoſition, his laws are full of mercy and love. Now God being <hi>love it ſelf,</hi> his law or command to man that he love his neighbour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth of Gods own nature, as flowing from it. So that the nearer we come to the fulfilling this law of love, the nearer we approach to the nature of God which is love.</p>
               <p>Chriſt therefore though at firſt he took not away all <hi>legall ſacrifices,</hi> yet he profeſt that he would <hi>have mercy and not ſacrifice,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 9.13.</note> or <hi>mercy</hi> rather then <hi>ſacrifice:</hi> but ſo as in the ſacrifice of <hi>Cain,</hi> if it were mingled with the hatred of his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> he rejected it: and in this or ſuch a ſacrifice he ſaith, <hi>I will have mercy and not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:</hi> and accordingly when the Scribe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering Chriſt according to his own doctrine, that to love our <hi>neighbour as our ſelf,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 12.13.</note> is more then all ſacrifices, Chriſt hereupon finding that the Scribe anſwered diſcreetly, and to the truth, he ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou art not farre from the kingdome of God:</hi> which is as much as if Chriſt
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:169899:40"/>had ſaid, thus to teach and ſo to doe is the ſtraight way to the kingdome of God, and without it there is no other way.</p>
               <p>In the Leviticall Law we read that God fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Jews to be hard hearted and mercileſs, to incline them to better and more loving diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions he gave them ſeverall Laws wherein he forbids them to eate <hi>bloud,</hi> and to boyle the <hi>kid in the milke of the damme,</hi> and injoyns them to leave the <hi>gleanings</hi> after harveſt for the poor, and ſome <hi>grapes</hi> for the paſſenger, and that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>ſeventh year</hi> the land ſhould have reſt, and the benefit thereof to accrew unto the poor. And although Chriſt was a zealous and ſtrict obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> as conſecrated to Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.27.</note> yet for the neceſſary reliefe of man he is content to diſpenſe with ſome part of that days ſervice, and therefore concludes that <hi>the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And according to this law of God and Chriſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> under the <hi>law,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Goſpel</hi> were ſo zealous in their loves to their brethren, that the former deſires to be <hi>blotted out of Gods book</hi> rather then his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen ſhould be deſtroyed,<note place="margin">Exod. 32</note> and the latter rather then his <hi>brethren in the fleſh</hi> ſhould not be ſaved, he could wiſh himſelf to be <hi>ſeparated from Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> or <hi>excommunicated</hi> from the Church.</p>
               <p>Some ancient Fathers are of opinion that when <hi>Elijah</hi> laboured to draw the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from their Idolatry to God,<note place="margin">1 King. 17.6.</note> and that himſelfe was there involved and driven near to famme, that God ſent <hi>Ravens</hi> a kind of bird which leaves her young, featherleſſe and meatleſſe to feed him, that thereby he might mollifie the heart of the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:169899:41"/>Prophet to be more tender to his countrey-men, and by his prayer to obtain rain, and the fruits of the earth for them.</p>
               <p>And without conjectures the text is plain, that the <hi>widow</hi> of <hi>Zarephah</hi> her compaſſionate love in feeding the Prophet out of her ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of her little <hi>meal</hi> and <hi>oyle,</hi> is recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſuch an increaſe,<note place="margin">1 King. 17.16.</note> that neither her <hi>oyle,</hi> nor her <hi>meal</hi> failed ſo long as the famine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. So true is that of our Saviour, <hi>Be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as your heavenly Father is mercifull;</hi> and, <hi>Give,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 6.37, 38.</note> 
                  <hi>and it ſhall be given unto you, good meaſure</hi> (as to the widow laſt mentioned) <hi>preſſed down, ſhaken together and running over: for with the ſame meaſure that you mete with all, it ſhall be meaſured to you again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſixt reaſon for this law of love is drawn from the <hi>end</hi> of all good laws, which are made that we may live in ſecurity, &amp; enjoy our peace, which is accompliſhed principally by this love to our neighbour. The old law given to the <hi>Jews</hi> by which they conceived that they might hate and kill their enemies,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.1</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>ſervitude</hi> or <hi>bondage,</hi> but the law of grace which commands love to all, he terms <hi>liberty:</hi> becauſe as by that law ſlavery, ſo by this, liberty is acquired to every ſtate. Again S. <hi>Paul</hi> building upon the ſame foundation raiſeth his work by <hi>bowels of mercies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gol. 3.12</note> 
                  <hi>kindneſſe, humbleneſſe of mind, forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, if any man have a quarrell againſt any even as Chriſt alſo forgave you, even ſo doe ye;</hi> and above all theſe things <hi>put on Charity which</hi> (as it is the foundation of all, ſo it) <hi>is the bond of all perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>S. <hi>Jerome</hi> writes of S. <hi>John</hi> that being through age grown ſo weak that he was carried by his diſciples to the Church, he ever and anon
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:169899:41"/>repeated this ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>Love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and being asked by them why ſo often he commemorated this text rather then any other, he anſwered, that in this they ſhould <hi>fulfill</hi> the whole law, inſomuch as none could love God unleſſe he loved his neighbour. In which others agree ſaying, that the love of God is the center of all our true love, on which the heart as on a point of the Compaſſe being ſet, the other point moves about the whole circumference of the world: and indeed he that carefully obſerveth the tenor of the Epiſtles of that beloved and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſciple S. <hi>John,</hi> he ſhall finde this often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon, that the love of God and of our neighbour are ſo inſeparable, that he that doth the one cannot but doe the other: for that the love of God neceſſarily produceth the love of our neighbour.</p>
               <p>And therefore when our Saviour before his departure out of the world would ſet a mark of diſtinction whereby his diſciples ſhould be known from all others, the note or mark was not preaching or prophecying: for happily <hi>Judas, Hymeneus, Philetus, Diotrephes</hi> or others might ſay as thoſe of whom Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>Lord, Lord, have not we prophecied in thy name?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 7.21, 22, 23</note> nor was the note of diſtinction the working miracles or caſting out devills: for <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and others in Chriſts name did the like, and of thoſe and ſuch like Chriſt ſaith, I take you not for my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, <hi>Depart hence, I know you not;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 13.35.</note> for my mark is love, and by this <hi>men ſhall know that ye are my diſciples,</hi> and ſuch as for whom I have prepared a place in my kingdome.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> The manner how we are to love our neighbour.</head>
               <p>THe Scripture hath given us <hi>three rules</hi> by which we are taught how to love our neighbour. The firſt is that of our Saviour, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 22.33.</note> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is that which Chriſt likewiſe preſcribes, <hi>as I have loved you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 13.34.1 Cor. 12 12.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo ſhall ye love one the other;</hi> the third is that of S. <hi>Paul</hi> comparing the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſts myſticall body to the parts of mans body naturall.</p>
               <p>The loving our <hi>neighbour</hi> as <hi>our ſelfe</hi> is to be underſtood firſt as deſiring the ſame graces ſpirituall and eternall to thy brother as to thy ſelfe; ſecondly, wiſhing in all things elſe the like to be done to thy neighbour as thou wiſheſt to be done to thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>And againſt this firſt rule of love we find in the world <hi>two offenders,</hi> the one in the <hi>exceſſe,</hi> the other in the <hi>defect,</hi> and among the former beſides ſome others whom I might touch, I may not amiſſe place ſome preachers in our times, who, as ſome Phyſitians, through co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet of gain or other reſpects ſo much intend the cure of others, that they neglect the health of their own bodies: ſo theſe by their preaching raiſe others and lye ſtill themſelves in their own ſins; of whom and ſuch like I may uſe S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words, <hi>Thou art inexcuſable O man:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2.1.21.</note> 
                  <hi>for thou that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt another, teacheſt thou not thy ſelf'?</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:169899:42"/>wiſe that of our Saviour, <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> thou that profeſſeſt to cure others, <hi>heal thy ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Defective Lover</hi> hath one <hi>ſcale</hi> wherein to weigh himſelf, and another for his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, which <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us is an <hi>abomination before God;</hi> yet too many ſuch there are,<note place="margin">Deut. 25.</note> who looking into their neighbors vertues or miſeries, they ſee them with <hi>diminiſhing-glaſſes,</hi> whereby they ſeem little or not conſiderable, the firſt as not to be commended, and the latter as not to be pitied: but upon their own ſufferings or actions, they look with eyes like <hi>multiplying-glaſſes,</hi> whereby their own actions ſeem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable, and their ſufferings intolerable. So that what in himſelf he fees as a <hi>beam,</hi> in his brother it is looked upon as a <hi>gnat</hi> or a <hi>ſtraw:</hi> whereas did they ſtate their Neighbours caſe and act to be as their own, then they might judge the better and more uprightly; and this were to love our <hi>Neighbour as our ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before I paſs from the firſt to the ſecond Rule in loving our Neighbour, I muſt obſerve, that there be ſome who are not capable of this rule to love their Neighbour as themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe themſelves are ſuch who love not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And if you wonder who theſe ſhould be, being that S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that no man ever <hi>hated himſelf,</hi> I muſt anſwer you, that the ſinners are the men that do not love themſelves:<note place="margin">Eph. 5.29.</note> for he who loves and follows that which is his ruine and deſtruction, cannot rightly be ſaid to love himſelf; and therefore if he love his Neighbour as himſelf, that is to make his Neighbour a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as himſelf: he may be rather ſaid to hate his Neighbour as himſelf, and not to love him, for that by his wicked love he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:169899:43"/>himſelf and his Neighbour.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond Rule</hi> in loving our Neighbour, Chriſt gives us,<note place="margin">Joh. 15.12.</note> ſaying, <hi>Love ye one the other as I have loved you:</hi> and this is that <hi>new Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> which Chriſt ſpeaks of, when he ſaith, <hi>A new Commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another, as I have loved you:</hi> and this is that makes the <hi>Commandment new,</hi> not the loving of our neighbour, for this, as before is ſhewed, is as old as the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature;</hi> but to love our neighbour as <hi>Chriſt loved us.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 13.34.</note> This is new, and therefore by Chriſt called <hi>A new Commandment,</hi> becauſe given in this new manner of loving, as Chriſt loved us.</p>
               <p>Now that we may love according to this rule, we muſt learn how Chriſt loved us, and that is expreſt in theſe words of our Saviour, <hi>As my Father loved me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jo. 15.9.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo do I love you:</hi> So that now we are to know how God the Father loved Chriſt his Son: and here we ſhall finde the Father in his love to his Son (as Man) confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all bleſſings, graces, and endowments upon him, and ſo we ſhall finde him loving Chriſt his Son. 2. Not for his wealth perſon, or any ſuch like thing, but freely. 3. That he loved him not in a fit, or for a time, but as Chriſt is ſaid where he loves,<note place="margin">Jo. 13.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>to love unto the end.</hi> Laſtly, though God thus loved his Son, and more then we can expreſs, yet he is content that this Son of his love ſhould dye for the good and ſalvation of his brethren. And thus as the Father loved his Son Chriſt; ſo Chriſt hath loved us: and as Chriſt hath loved us, ſo he commands us to love our neighbour: and this is the ſecond Rule.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third Rule</hi> is taken from the compariſon made betwixt the members of mans body,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.</note> and thoſe of the <hi>myſtical body</hi> of Chriſt: And here
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:169899:43"/>firſt we ſhall conſider that as in the former the members of mans body, ſo in the latter the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, there ſhould not be any envy or grudging in any one member, be it never ſo loyw or mean, at the good or proſperity of the other: For as every member hath its particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar office; ſo no one member can ſay to the other: <hi>I have no need of thee:</hi> but God having given them diſtinct offices, whereby the one ſerveth and helpeth the other, there can be no envious or malignant humor among them; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if the members of Chriſt love as thoſe of the body (as they ought) can there be any grudging or repining betwixt Chriſtians which are the members of Chriſt; for the honorable &amp; rich cannot ſay to the low and poor, <hi>We have no need of you:</hi> for they have need of their prayers, their corporal ſervice, and other helps, and therefore are not to be proud over them: nor can the low and poor ſay they have no need of the rich and honorable, for they have need of their defence from wrongs, and relief in time of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and therefore ſmall cauſe have they to envy that which affords them defence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. The <hi>eye</hi> ſet on high, deſpiſeth not the <hi>foot</hi> that goes on the ground: nor doth the <hi>foot</hi> that treads on the earth, envy the high place of the <hi>eye;</hi> and ſo ought it to be with the rich and honorable, and with the low and needy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in our natural bodies the members each are ſubſervient and mutually aſſiſting each to others; the eye by his light guideth the foot from falling, and the hand in working: and the foot and hand return a reciprocal office to the eye, the one in carrying, the other in help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and defending the eye. The like may be ſaid of the head to the ear, and of the ear to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:169899:44"/>the head, of the ſtomach to the reſt of the parts, and of the reſt of the parts to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; and ſo ſhould it be in the <hi>body myſtical,</hi> that the members thereof may relieve and help each other in all caſes and kindes wherein the members are made or become able to help each other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in the body natural of man, where <hi>one member ſuffers, all the members ſuffer with it;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.29.</note> and when one member is <hi>honored,</hi> all the members rejoyce with it: and ſo ſhould it be among the members of Chriſt, that each may ſay as S. <hi>Paul, Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?</hi> Naturaliſts obſerve, That Harts and Hinds ſwimming over a river or ſtream, the head of the follower is laid on the hanches of the former, and this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being weary, turns about and is ſupported by the latter. Nay, we daily ſee, that the Swine, yea and the fearful Deer, if hunted or worried by a Dog, will ſhelter or ſtrive to help and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend each other: and ſhall theſe beaſts, by the inſtinct of Nature, excel Chriſtians in the mutual help of each other?</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> That we ought to love our Enemies.</head>
               <p>TO prove this, we need adde no more to the former Chapter, then to ſhew, that under our Neighbour, Chriſt underſtandeth, and comprehendeth our <hi>enemy.</hi> And that it is ſo, we need no further proof, then that which our Saviour manifeſted in the parable, where when the Lawyer asked Chriſt, <hi>Who is my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 10.29.</note> Chriſt told him, that a poor Jew was robbed and wounded, who being neglected by the <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Levite,</hi> yet was comforted and relieved by a Samaritan: now the <hi>Samaritans</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> being divided in their Religions, as another Goſpel hath it, have no dealings toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, witneſs the ſame Text, where the woman ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>How is it that thou being a Jew,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 4.9.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhouldeſt ſo much as ask a cup of water of me that am a Samaritan?</hi> upon this Chriſt, by way of ſatisfaction to the Lawyers queſtion, demands of the Lawyer, whom he took to be neighbour to the wounded <hi>Jew?</hi> whether the <hi>Jew</hi> who paſſed by not helping him, or the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan</hi> who hated the <hi>Jew?</hi> and the Lawyer, as convinced in judgement and conſcience, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and roundly anſwered, The <hi>Samaritan,</hi> who helped the <hi>Jew</hi> whom otherwiſe he hated, was neighbour to the <hi>Jew;</hi> and upon that verdict thus given by the Jewiſh Lawyer, Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth this doctrine by way of exhortation, <hi>Go and do likewiſe;</hi> that is, have mercy, and love ' thine enemy.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:169899:45"/>
               <p>And what Chriſt preached here, he practiſed to the full; for had Chriſt any ſo great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies unto him as the <hi>Jews,</hi> who notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the good works that he did among and for them, yet hated and perſecuted him to his death: and when they cryed loudly to the Judge <hi>Crucifie him,</hi> he more fervently prayes to his Father to <hi>forgive</hi> them, and when they madly wiſhed, that his <hi>blood might be upon them and their children,</hi> he mildly pronounced, that his blood ſhould be ſhed for them and their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Could there be any greater ſigns of the <hi>Jews</hi> enmity to Chriſt? and could there be any greater evidence of Chriſts love to the <hi>Jews?</hi> and according to his practice, he gives his law, <hi>As I have loved you, even ſo love ye your neighbour,</hi> though he be your enemy.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this ſo plain and evident truth, there have not wanted who have urged reaſons againſt this poſition, as the Rabbies <hi>maſters</hi> or <hi>expounders</hi> of the Moſaical Law, who feign, that though the Commandment of loving our neighbour, was written by God in the <hi>Tables</hi> of <hi>Stone</hi> delivered unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet it was written in the heart of man to hate his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. 2. They urge that of our Lord God to <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Kings 3.11.</note> ſaying, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt not asked long life, nor riches, nor the life of thine enemies, I have given thee a wife heart:</hi> whence they would infer, that revenge on our enemies is as juſtifiably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired as long life. 3. They adde, that <hi>David,</hi> of whom not onely himſelf, but God pronounced, that he had walked according to his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; yet <hi>David</hi> uſed many and bitter curſes and imprecations againſt his enemies. 4. To perſwade us that this is natural to man, they will tell us, that a childe being offended with
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:169899:45"/>any, will ſoon be pleaſed, if another will but ſtrike and revenge him upon the perſon that gave him the offence. 5. They urge ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of ancient Fathers, who deem this hate of enemies to have been permitted to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as that of <hi>Divorce,</hi> for the hardneſs of their hearts.</p>
               <p>To the firſt argument I may ſay, That ſuch a <hi>Tradition</hi> as is alleaged by the Rabbies, is not to be regarded, but to be rejected as frivolous and falfe.</p>
               <p>But if any adde, that it ſhould ſeem by the words of Chriſt himſelf, that in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, or at leaſt before Chriſt, there was ſuch a <hi>Tradition</hi> among the the Jews, as that it was permitted to them to hate their enemies, for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid of old,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 5.43.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I may anſwer, That the words of Chriſt, <hi>It hath been ſaid of old,</hi> might relate to the perverſe interpretation of the Scribes, who argued, That ſeeing we are to love our <hi>neighbors,</hi> that is, ſay they, our <hi>friends,</hi> therefore we may hate our <hi>enemies:</hi> or becauſe God commanded to make no peace with nor to ſpare the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites,</hi> but deſtroy them, therefore we might do the like to all our enemies. But to this, or that old ſaying, we need ſay no more then what Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>Ye have heard it ſaid of old,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">V. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt hate thine enemy: but I ſay unto you, Love your enemies, bleſſ them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding this, they urge, That by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> as much is implyed as the hate of our enemies: for it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:169899:46"/>not hate thy brother:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lev. 19.17. Deut. 15.7.</note> and <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>Thou ſhalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge againſt the children of thy people:</hi> from which Texts and the like they would infer, That they may hate and avenge themſelves on all but their brethren, and the children of their own people, which were the <hi>Jews</hi> onely, and therefore all the reſt they might hate as their accounted enemies.</p>
               <p>But to this we anſwer, That it is an impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their own making without ground from the Text, which may be proved from other Texts, which command the love of our enemy, and the Spirit of God doth not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not command contradictions: Now God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>If thou meet thine enemies beaſt ſtraying,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 23.4. Prov. 25.21.</note> 
                  <hi>thou ſhalt bring it back to him,</hi> that is, to thine <hi>enemy:</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> (which words S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 12.20 urgerh to our Saviours ſenſe) <hi>If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat, and if he be thirſty, give him to drink, and the Lord will reward thee.</hi> Here is no ſign nor tittle of hate or revenge to our enemy, but quite contrary, to ſhew him the fruits of our love in doing him good.</p>
               <p>And if to any the hate of our enemies ſeem natural, I muſt ſay, It muſt be to ſuch as are of a perverſe corrupted Jewiſh diſpoſition, and not to the nature of a true Chriſtian: for can any man conceive that <hi>God who is love,</hi> and is moſt delighted with <hi>mercy and love,</hi> ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe into the heart of man, created after his own <hi>image,</hi> hatred and revenge, and that againſt his neighbour, his brother, who likewiſe bears the image of his Maker, who is Love?</p>
               <p>That <hi>David</hi> uſed imprecations againſt many, is not to be denyed, but denyed it muſt be, that it was againſt them becauſe ſimply his enemies,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:169899:46"/>but rather againſt them as <hi>Gods enemies,</hi> not <hi>his.</hi> 2. The imprecations were not againſt their <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> directly, as to the deſtruction of their ſoul or body, but againſt them as they were ſinners. 3. It was for the <hi>converſion</hi> of ſinners, and that Gods glory might appear either by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion or deſtruction, and not to the ſatisfying his own revenge.</p>
               <p>Obſerve I pray with me, That <hi>David</hi> in his Pſalms is often ſaid to hate, but what? ſin, not the man; for ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>I hate the work of them that turn aſide.</hi> Pſal. 119. <hi>v.</hi> 104. <hi>I hate every falſe way.</hi> Ver. 113. <hi>I hate vain thoughts.</hi> Ver. 163. I <hi>hate lying;</hi> and if once, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. <hi>v.</hi> 21. he be found to hate them, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yet obſerve, <hi>v.</hi> 22. he is ſaid to <hi>hate them with a perfect hatred,</hi> which hate can onely be ſuch, when it is againſt that which God hates, the <hi>ſin,</hi> but not the <hi>perſon</hi> of the man, which is an imperfect hatred, and againſt charity, and ſuch an hatred God abhorreth: Hear <hi>David</hi> ſpeak as to his rebellious Son <hi>Abſolom,</hi> his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous Couſin <hi>Joab,</hi> and foul-mouth'd <hi>Shimei, Pſal.</hi> 7.4, 5. <hi>If I have rewarded evil to mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, let him perſecute my ſoul, tread down my life, and lay mine honour in the duſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> becauſe God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and bleſſed him for not deſiring the blood of his enemies, from hence to conclude, that he might have hated or revenged himſelf upon his enemies, is all one as to ſay, God loves and bleſſeth the humble, the chaſte, and the ſober: therefore a man may be proud, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcivious, a glutton, or a drunkard.</p>
               <p>But paſſing by what is, or may be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued in deſence of hate, or revenge to our enemies; it is eaſie to ſhew, and prove
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:169899:47"/>that it is <hi>unnatural,</hi> and againſt the law of God ſo to do: and that the contrary, to love them, is not onely commanded, and praiſed as <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> but eaſie to be performed even by the Heathen.</p>
               <p>The royal Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thy law is ſweeter and more pleaſant to me then honey,<note place="margin">Pſa. 19.10.</note> or the honey-comb:</hi> and our Saviour Chriſt ſpeaking of his Law, which is this, to love and not hate our enemies,<note place="margin">Matth. 11.30.</note> he calls it, though a <hi>yoke</hi> and a <hi>burthen,</hi> yet ſuch as he profeſſeth to be <hi>eaſie</hi> and <hi>light.</hi> But we muſt conſider to whom it is ſuch, not to the carnal worldling and meer natural man, but to his <hi>diſciple,</hi> whom he underſtands to be a <hi>new creature,</hi> born and begotten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the Spirit of grace, and then to ſuch a nature it is as natural to love his enemy, as it is natural to the other to hate him.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is, for that as the <hi>Elements</hi> of <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> though of themſelves ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and heavy, yet while they are in their own place they presſ not, nor are burthenſom: So is the love of an <hi>enemy</hi> in an heart ſpiritual: And as the <hi>armour of Saul</hi> before <hi>David</hi> was exerciſed in bearing arms, was cumberſom unto him, but after much uſe and practiſe in the war, he could wield the great <hi>Sword</hi> of the Giant <hi>Goliah,</hi> and ſay as he did to <hi>Abimelech, There is none like unto that;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 21.9.</note> even ſo fareth it with him who hath practiſed and exerciſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this holy duty of loving an <hi>enemy,</hi> which an humble ſpiritual uſe and exerciſe will make not onely tolerable, but joyous and delight-full.</p>
               <p>May not this and much more be confirmed by the <hi>examples</hi> of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who being ſold trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly by his brethren,<note place="margin">Gen. 45.</note>

                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>would God I had dyed for thee, O Abſolom my ſon, my ſon.</hi> Now can we conceive that more love then this in <hi>Joſeph, Moſes</hi> and <hi>David</hi> to their greateſt enemies, could have been ſhewed by any other to their deareſt friends? So true is this, that love of an enemy in a ſoul purified and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with patience, proves not onely <hi>conna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> to it, but moſt eaſie and delightful.</p>
               <p>Nay further, if any ſhall ſay, theſe indeed were rare examples of men extraordinarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with <hi>heavenly gifts</hi> of faith, love and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and to theſe, and ſuch as theſe, it was no hard matter thus to love their enemies: To this let me reply and tell you, that Heathens who, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of them, <hi>know not God,</hi> yet by the light of reaſon, and by the help of <hi>humane patience</hi> alone, have come near to theſe moſt illightned and ſanctified men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the art of loving your <hi>enemies,</hi> is not ſo hard a thing to the naturall man, if he would give his minde to it.</p>

               <p>If any ask me, May I not <hi>ſue</hi> my neighbour or mine enemy, who hath taken or kept away my goods? or may I not implead him who hath robbed me of my good name?

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:169899:48"/>bound to ſue and implead him, that by a moderate and lawful chaſtiſement, he may ſee his faults, repent, and do no more ſo, and hereby thou ſhalt in part, and as much as in thee is, ſave his ſoul, which is no piece of <hi>hate,</hi> but a great part of <hi>love,</hi> that thou ſhouldeſt bear to thy neighbour.</p>
               <p>If it be yet urged, that the <hi>voyce of the blood of Abel cryeth to God</hi> for vengeance;<note place="margin">Gen. 4.10.</note> and that the <hi>Souls of them that were ſlain for the word of God, and for the teſtimony which they held,</hi> cry with a loud voyce, ſaying, <hi>How long, O Lord, holy and true,</hi>

                  <hi>doſt thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The general anſwer to the <hi>cryes</hi> of Gods Saints or holy ones (living or dead) to God for vengeance, is, That theſe as holy ones and Saints, deſire nothing againſt, but according to his will. 2. Not ſo much, or not directly to the torture of their <hi>perſons,</hi> as to the deſtruction of their <hi>violence, rapine</hi> and <hi>murther,</hi> under which the Saints and holy ones ſuffer.</p>
               <p>And to that place more eſpecially of the ſouls crying, <hi>How long, O Lord, doſt thou not judge and avenge?</hi> know, that theſe ſouls in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

Theſe ſouls being the ſame with them, cannot be deemed to pray, for ought more then what is ſuitable to Chriſtian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and the kingdom attained by it, which cannot be <hi>revenge,</hi> or that ſuch holy ones ſhould deſire it, but that which they deſire, is, 1. That Gods <hi>juſtice</hi> may be ſeen in his <hi>vengeance</hi> on thoſe perſecutors of his holy Martyrs. 2. That God would <hi>ſhorten</hi> the time of thoſe ten Roman

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> Motives and Reaſons inducing love to our Enemies.</head>
               <p>AND the firſt main <hi>reaſon</hi> may be drawn from the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Maker</hi> of this Law, which is <hi>Chriſt, God bleſſed for ever.</hi> Who tells us,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.14.</note> Ye have heard of old that ye may <hi>hate your enemies:</hi> but I ſay, Follow not all that you have heard, but that which I tell and inſtruct you, who <hi>am the Way, the Truth and Life</hi> it ſelf, and <hi>I ſay, Love your enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now concerning mans carriage or demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to his neighbour, we have <hi>three ſeveral Laws</hi> and Law-makers: the one <hi>Law</hi> is that of a <hi>friend</hi> to love his <hi>friend,</hi> which though it may and <hi>ſhould</hi> be from God, yet very often it is from the world and worldly reſpects; Chriſt himſelf intimateth little leſs, when he ſaith, <hi>When thou makeſt a dinner,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 14.12.</note> 
                  <hi>call not thy friends, nor thy rich neighbours,</hi> as though this were the uſe or law of the world, to love and make much of their friends. The ſecond, is of an <hi>enemy</hi> to an <hi>enemy,</hi> each of which hunt and take all occaſions to proſecute one another with vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious law-ſuits and quarrels; and the maker of this law is the Devil, who, as Chriſt witneſſeth,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:169899:49"/>is <hi>a murtherer from the beginning.</hi> The third and laſt law is this, not only of love to a <hi>friend,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John. 8.44.</note> but to an <hi>enemy,</hi> and this is Gods, when he ſaith, <hi>But I ſay, love your enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It hath ever held as juſt and reaſonable, to give reverence and obedience to <hi>good Laws;</hi> partly for the reſpect we ſhew to the Juſtice, Wiſedome and Integrity of the Law-giver. With the diſciples of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, it was enough to ſay, he <hi>our maſter ſpoke it;</hi> and this with them was confirmation ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of the ſaying. We reade of the Rechabites, that <hi>becauſe they had obeyed the Commandment of Jonadab their father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 35.18.</note> 
                  <hi>therefore there ſhould not want a man to ſtand before God for ever.</hi> And of <hi>Laban</hi> it is recorded, that when he purpoſed miſchief againſt <hi>Jacob,</hi> he deſiſted, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his enmity into good: why? for ſaith he, <hi>The God of your father ſpake unto me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 31.29.</note> 
                  <hi>ſaying, Take heed, that thou ſpeak not unto Jacob either good or bad,</hi> or from good to bad; and this authority <hi>Laban</hi> the Syrian, though an Heathen and an Idolater, obeyed.</p>
               <p>Now the Author of this precept is no leſs, but the ſame who ſpoke unto <hi>Laban,</hi> who now ſaith, I who am the <hi>King of kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of lords,</hi> I who from the beginning have created and made all, I who from the beginning to the end make <hi>Laws,</hi> and puniſh the breakers of them; and none can deliver; I, even I give you this law to be obſerved for ever, <hi>Love your enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this being the law of God, then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the law of <hi>Duels,</hi> ſo underſtood, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in theſe latter and worſer times, be the law of God or of Devils, judge ye: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think your ſelves in time, whether he the ſame
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:169899:50"/>God that gives this law of <hi>Love to out enemies,</hi> will not judge and ſeverely puniſh the deſpiſers of his authority, and the breakers of this his juſt and ſweet Law with everlaſting hell-fire.</p>
               <p>A ſecond reaſon may be drawn from the love of this Law-giver God unto his enemies, and he ſaith,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.45.</note> I that give my light <hi>to ſhine upon the good and on the bad,</hi> and ſend my <hi>rain on the juſt and on the unjuſt,</hi> and ſo impartially, that if my <hi>rain of afflictions</hi> fall firſt on the juſt, yet my <hi>Suns proſperity</hi> doth firſt ſhine on the bad. And again, I who not onely pardoned my perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and murtherers, but dyed for all my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enemies; I who have done this and more, give you this law, wherein if you have any thing of children, diſciples, or Chriſtians in you, ye will imitate and obey me, for it is I who ſay and command, <hi>Love your enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſee further, that when this Law-giver Chriſt had given this command of love to our enemies but in general in the fifth Chapter of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> in the next Chapter he teacheth the manner how we ſhould love them, when in his moſt divine Prayer he bade them <hi>to forgive them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>as they wiſhed and prayed that God would forgive themſelves:</hi> and to give them an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple not onely in the general, which was not yet ſo ſenſible to all, he ſhews and gives us a patern of this his love, when a night or two before his paſſion, he not onely waſheth the feet of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> but he feaſts him with the reſt of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; and though he knew him to be a Thief, an Apoſtate, and a <hi>Traytor,</hi> yet as though he had forgiven him, he calls him <hi>friend.</hi> And it is the. reaſonable conjecture of an ancient Father, That to the Thief who dyed with Chriſt, and heard him pray for, and to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:169899:50"/>forgive his enemies, it became an eſpecial mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to his belief, and thereby to his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>A third reaſon for this love to our enemies, is the benefits redounding thence to our ſelves: <hi>For my Names ſake</hi> (that is,<note place="margin">Iſa. 48.9</note> for mine honor's) <hi>and for my praiſe,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>I will refrain</hi> (and not revenge or puniſh) and man loving and pardoning his enemies, is made partaker of this <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>praiſe</hi> with God. <hi>How often,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 18.21.</note> ſaith S. <hi>Peter</hi> to Chriſt, <hi>ſhall my brother ſin againſt me, and I forgive him?</hi> where the remitter of his enemies injuries is called by the Apoſtle a <hi>forgiver:</hi> and is not this a great honour, and highly to be eſteemed, to participate in the like title with God, to be a <hi>forgiver?</hi> But (hear on) he that is out of charity, and foſtereth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in his heart, is like a man wounded or ſick of an <hi>hectick Feaver;</hi> now the firſt means to cure and recover this infirm perſon, is to waſh away the corrupted blood, and to purge out the putrefied humor, which is the rancor and hatred burning in the ſoul, and this is effected by love, for love caſts out hate and revenge; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou doſt thy ſelf, and not thy enemy the good.</p>
               <p>But again conſider, if thou wert to appear before a Judge whoſe Son thou haſt killed, wouldſt thou ſhew thy hands to that Judge all reaking in his Sons blood? The caſe is much alike in him who prays for mercy and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from Chriſt the great <hi>Judge,</hi> while his heart and hands are full of malice and revenge to his brother, who is the <hi>image</hi> and Son of the Father which is in heaven. I ſhall not need to adde what Chriſt the Judge hath determined in this caſe,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.33.</note>in that <hi>Parable</hi> of the mercileſs fellow-ſervant,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:169899:51"/>to whom when his Lord, which is God, had forgiven him his debt of <hi>ten thouſand ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,</hi> yet he would not forgive his fellow an <hi>hundred pence.</hi> Now the ſentence of this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs wretch, is pronounced by the juſt Judge of all the world in theſe words; <hi>O thou wicked ſervant, I forgave thee all, not a part, but all thy debt, and ſhouldeſt not thou have had compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on thy fellow-ſervant, even as I had pity on thee?</hi> but ſithence thou art ſo uncharitable, hear thy unreverſible doom, Thou ſhalt be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered</hi> to the Tormentors the Devils, till thou haſt paid all thy debt, which thou canſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all this, how many finde we profeſt Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.4, 5.</note> who <hi>deſpiſing the riches of Gods goodneſs, and forbearance, and long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after the hardneſs of their impenitent hearts, treaſure up unto themſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath,</hi> and all through their hatred, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and revenge toward their brethren? For have we not many, too too many, who not onely practiſe, but profeſs their rancor to thoſe that have offended them, or to thoſe whom without any juſt cauſe they love not, and not onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs this, but have left it as apart of their laſt Will, as <hi>David</hi> did to his Son <hi>Solomon,</hi> to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſuch as <hi>Joab</hi> and <hi>Shimei,</hi> who had offended him? We have read of <hi>Eſaus</hi> malicious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful heart toward his brother <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he ſaid,<note place="margin">Gen. 27.41.</note> 
                  <hi>The dayes of mourning will come, and then will I ſlay my brother;</hi> and of <hi>Saul,</hi> who ſo long nouriſhed a malicious thought to deſtroy <hi>David,</hi> and that of <hi>Abſolom,</hi> who for two years ſpace made fair profeſſions, eating and drinking with his brother <hi>Ammon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 13.</note> whoſe direful ſoul never ceaſed boiling in revenge, until he had killed
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:169899:51"/>him at a feaſt, perhaps when he was full of wine, and thereby as much as in him lay, with his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, deſtroyed his ſoul alſo.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives better counſel, ſaying, <hi>Be ye kinde one to another, forgiving one another,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4.32.</note> 
                  <hi>as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven you.</hi> And not onely this, but as a mean hereunto, he premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>Let all bitterneſs, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil ſpeaking, be put away, with all malice:</hi> where you may by the way obſerve, the generation, production and growth of this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to our neighbour; where the laſt in the text, <hi>malice,</hi> is the feed and matter of <hi>clamour and evil ſpeaking;</hi> as <hi>evil ſpeaking and clamour,</hi> ariſe from <hi>anger and wrath,</hi> and theſe from a bitter ſowre <hi>ill-leavened ſoul.</hi> And why we ſhould not be angry or malicious, the Apoſtle gives us the reaſon, when he ſaith, <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of love, meekneſs, long-ſuffering,</hi> and hater of all thoſe that hate their brethren.</p>
               <p>A fourth reaſon to quench this hatred and revenge againſt our brethren, may hence ariſe, becauſe God hath openly declared and given ſentence againſt the ſame. Obſerve S. <hi>Paul,</hi> how large he is in one Chapter upon this <hi>Theme,</hi> who bids us to <hi>Bleſs them that perſecute us.</hi>

               <p>The Almighty God by his Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles is ſaid to be <hi>rich in mercy,</hi>

               <p>And as God is moſt pleaſed with this attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of Merciful, as conducing moſt to his glory: ſo in imitating God herein, man moſt proves himſelf to be his Fathers own childe: for as our Saviour ſpake of the hard-hearted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful Jews,<note place="margin">Joh. 8.44.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye are of your father the devil, who was a murtherer from the beginning:</hi> ſo ſaith he, <hi>Love your enemies,</hi>

               <p>And ſuch as croſs and oppoſe this doctrine
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:169899:53"/>of our Lord Chriſt, ſaying in heart or tongue, it is baſeneſs and cowardize to put up an affront without taking revenge; I muſt pronounce that man not onely a <hi>baſtard,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls ſuch, &amp; no ſon of God, but an heretick to Chriſts do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, whoſe precept is, <hi>Love your enemies.</hi> We reade, that our Saviour told his diſciples, that for his ſake they ſhould ſuffer, and forſake eſtates, wife, children and life, but never that they ſhould ſuffer for his name or doctrine, any loſs of reputation or honour: whence it will eaſily follow, that to obey Chriſts command in pardoning the offences of our neighbour, and in loving our enemy, we loſe not, but gain that which indeed with God and good men is truly called and known to be honour.</p>
               <p>To incline mans heart to this duty, is the conſideration of that trouble and torture which hate and revenge brings into the ſoul of man. This appears by many inſtances in holy Writ: <hi>Cain,</hi> after the murther of his brother, became a <hi>fugitive in the land of Nod,</hi>

               </head>
               <p>OUR Saviour Chriſt commands us to love our neighbours;<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.</note> and <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. to love our enemies; but I read not that he ever counſelled us to love our friends, not that he thought them unworthy to be loved, as more eſpecially compriſed under the title of <hi>neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> but he omitted this precept or counſel, for that every one would, as moſt bound, love them of their own accord; and indeed, Chriſt himſelf expreſſeth ſo much, when be ſaith, the <hi>Heathen Publicans</hi> who are ranged with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>6.</note> theſe love their friends.</p>
               <p>But becauſe friendſhip hath been uſed and worn as a Cloak, to do and cover much deceit and iniquity, I will therefore follow the method of the Pſalmiſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 1.</note> where from deſcribing the wicked, he makes his way to the godly: ſo here I ſhall firſt note the diſguiſes and falſities of counterfeit friends, that avoiding theſe, we may the better chooſe and love the true and good ones.</p>
               <p>And the firſt rank of theſe are like <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 49.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Brethren</hi> or friends ſo made and joyned together by the <hi>cords,</hi> as the Prophet calls them, <hi>of iniquity:</hi> ſuch are they of whom <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, who cry, <hi>Come let us lye in wait for blood, come let us fill our ſelves with ſtrong drink, and come let us take our fill of luſt:</hi> the world hath, and ever will be too full of ſuch conſpirators, not friends. Such were <hi>Joſephs</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:169899:58"/>brethren, when they ſold him; ſuch were the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate, Jews</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> made friends in a moſt wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy to murther the annointed of the Lord: of theſe I may ſay as <hi>Jacob, O my ſoul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 49.6.</note> 
                  <hi>come not thou into their ſecret; curſed be their wrath, for it was cruel: divide them therefore, O Lord, in Jacob, and ſcatter them in Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another rank of falſe friends are ſuch, who under the cover of ſheepskins, get in and play the Wolves to the ſpoil and deſtruction of the ſimple and innocent-minded man; and of this ſort was <hi>Cain,</hi> who as ſome Rabbies ſpake,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

With this rank of men, as King <hi>David</hi> was too well acquainted, ſo he often complains of, and prayes againſt them, as being of his <hi>counſell,</hi> and eating of his bread;<note place="margin">Pſa. 94.</note> yet while they had <hi>butter and oyle in their lips, their hearts and tongues were ſpears, ſwords, and very poyſon.</hi> Theſe to <hi>David</hi> were more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous then his publick enemies: for, <hi>of thoſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I could have taken heed,</hi> but the others I miſtruſted not. The <hi>Thief,</hi> that robbed in the day, if he were killed,<note place="margin">Exod. 22.3, 4.</note> the <hi>blood of the killer</hi> was to be ſhed for him; but if he robbed in the dark, and was ſlain, the <hi>killer</hi> was not to dye for it: ſo much are the diſguiſes and <hi>works of darkneſs</hi> abominable in the ſight of God, more then apert and open villany.</p>
               <p>Of theſe I might counſel, as the Philoſophers and wiſe-men have done, Try before you truſt,

                  <hi>Take heed every, one of his neighbour, and truſt not any brother: for they will deceive,</hi>

                  <hi>they will tell lies, and commit ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, therefore I will melt and try them, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a third ſort of falſe friends, who make ſhew of love when all tends to their own benefit or advantage. Such are they ſpoken of by the Prophet,<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.23.</note> 
                  <hi>Every one loveth gifts, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth after rewards.</hi> Such were <hi>Jobs</hi> friends; ſuch the <hi>Prodigals</hi> lovers in the Goſpel, who like Mice, Whores and Swallows, make love, and frequent your houſe in the ſummer of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, but in the end prove like <hi>Acteons</hi> hounds to be your deſtroyers. The wiſe-man diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth and rangeth this kinde of friendſhip, into a friend for his occaſion,<note place="margin">Ecclus. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. v. 7. v. 10, 11.</note> and to a friend at thy table, and to a friend in proſperity; theſe are to be tryed as metals, not by colour nor weight, theſe are deceitful, but by fire, and the hammer: by the <hi>fire</hi> of <hi>danger</hi> and <hi>adverſity,</hi> and by the <hi>hammer</hi> of <hi>trouble</hi> and <hi>perſecution:</hi> If they will endure and burniſh, and look bright under theſe, take and hold them for good, if not, reject them as counterfeit.</p>
               <p>The fourth kinde of falſe friends, is that who loves for his own delight, be it of thy beauty, feature, or other outward parts or gifts: and theſe are not unlike to Lice, which ſo long as the body hath ſweat and foul matter, they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:169899:59"/>but no longer: and their love is like the Apple of <hi>Sodom,</hi> or the beaſt called <hi>Acucena,</hi> which in twice handling yields an ill ſavour. We have Gardens, Parks and Chambers full of theſe, I would I could not truly ſay Churches full of ſuch, whoſe love is moſt ſeen in being ſeen, touched and taſted. But as the flowers of the Garden hold not long their colour or ſent, ſo nor this love. They cry, <hi>Let its crown our ſelves with roſes, let us eat, drink, take our fill of love;</hi> and ſuddenly they, as their love is, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and <hi>their place no where to be found.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſa. 37.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Betwixt theſe falſe vitious loves, and the true moral friendſhip, there is a <hi>natural love,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered, foſtered and encreaſed by a ſimilitude in the outward ſhape or inward qualities; and ſuch is that whereof we ſay, <hi>Like loves its Like,</hi> and <hi>Birds of a feather will fly together:</hi> But this being in it ſelf ſimply neither good nor ill, but may prove either as it is applied and uſed, I will paſs it by.</p>
               <p>And tell you what the true <hi>moral love</hi> or <hi>friendſhip</hi> is, and what is required to the birth and growth thereof. Some Philoſophers have called a friend another ſelf, underſtanding thereby, that although friendſhip be betwixt two, yet that theſe two had but one ſoul, that is, but one will and affection in two bodies: ſo that <hi>Tully</hi> hath more largely deſcribed friendſhip to be a mutual and reciprocal will and deſire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two, in all good things divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, by which will and deſire each ſtudieth the others good, as earneſtly and affectionately as his own; yea and ſo far oft-times, than he preferreth the outward good of his friend, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his own: And that ſuch friendship hath been found, they tell us of <hi>Pylades</hi> and <hi>Oreſtes,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:169899:60"/>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pythias, Theſeus</hi> and <hi>Pirithous,</hi> who took upon them to be the perſons of their friends impriſoned and in danger of life, thereby to hazard their own liberties and lives, for the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and preſervation of their friends.</p>
               <p>To the ſetling and confirming of this friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, I ſhall lay down ſome conditions, as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily requiſite: Firſt, that there be a kinde of <hi>equality</hi> betwixt friends, which though the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Roman <hi>Tully</hi> allows not, yet with ſome Grecians it paſſed as a Proverb, that <hi>Amity is Equality,</hi> which is to be underſtood not ſo much in the outward eſtate and place of wealth, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and office, as in the condeſcenſion and ſubmiſſion of the reaſon and will of the one to the other, with a due obſervation to the place and dignity of the other. And ſo <hi>Jonathan,</hi> though the eldeſt Son of King <hi>Saul,</hi> became a friend to <hi>David a ſhepherd:</hi> for, ſaith, the Text, <hi>the ſoul of Jonathan was knit with the ſoul of David,</hi>

                  <hi>and Jonathan loved him as his own ſoul;</hi> and in this reſpect may a King be a friend to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: for Chriſt himſelf thus calleth his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and true followers <hi>friends,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>A ſecond condition requiſite to this confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:169899:60"/>of friendſhip, is a <hi>community</hi> of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable goods. <hi>Plato,</hi> the great Philoſopher, held this ſo neceſſary not only for friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt private men, but for the general peace in a State, that he baniſhed from his Common-wealth this thing called <hi>Mine</hi> and <hi>Thine,</hi> as the onely bane both of friendſhip and publick peace; which opinion ſome wiſe men have approved, with this ſmall diſtinction of <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> and <hi>uſe:</hi> So that though the one friend, according to the Law, be the <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Proprietary</hi> of his Lands and Moneys, yet the <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>benefit</hi> thereof in caſe of neceſſity or conveniency, ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged to his friend. And ſurely, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>if we have Chriſt, with him we have all things,</hi> for all things are his: ſo he that hath the ſoul and the heart of a friend, with and by theſe he cannot but command for his neceſſary uſe his temporal goods; which, as before, he that ſhall deny in ſo doing, he denies himſelf to be a friend.</p>
               <p>And this condition hath a great part of its ground from this, That betwixt friends there muſt be, as before I ſpake of <hi>Jonathan</hi> to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> but <hi>one ſoul</hi> or the ſoul of the one ſo knit to tho other, that each loveth the other as it were with the ſame ſoul. This love is expreſt to be betwixt the <hi>bridegroom</hi> and the <hi>bride,</hi> Chriſt and his Church, where ſhe ſaith, <hi>My beloved is mine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 2.16.</note> 
                  <hi>and I am his:</hi> where firſt he is made hers by the love of his ſoul, and then, <hi>I am my well-beloved,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">c. 6.3.</note> 
                  <hi>and my beloved is mine;</hi> ſhe firſt returns her ſoul and love to him, and confirms his to her ſelf: and when love hath thus united their ſouls, all the affections and actions of the ſoul to ſay, will, and do the ſame thing, will follow.</p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:169899:61"/>
               <p>It is ſtoried of <hi>two twins,</hi> That when the one laughed or cried, or the like, the other did the ſame: and ſo it ſhould be betwixt friends, and ſuch friendſhip or love is commended unto us in holy Writ, not onely by the example of Chriſts diſciples, who were ſaid to be of the <hi>ſame minde,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 2. &amp; 4. Rom. 12.15.</note> but by their precept to us, as when it is ſaid, <hi>Rejoyce with them that do rejoyce, and weep with them that weep:</hi> and then in the next words, which cauſeth this mutual compaſſion, <hi>Be of the ſame minde one towards another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And not onely have we this precept, but Chriſt hath prayed, that we be enabled to the performance hereof, when he ſpeaks to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Holy Father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 17.11.</note> 
                  <hi>keep thoſe whom thou haſt given me, that they may be one as we are one:</hi> and thus the heart of friends being made one in an honeſt holy love, the one ſhall not will, nor ever bear the ſway, but they will in ſome things ſo ſubmit to the judgement and will of the other, that neither ſhall ſeem to over-rule the other, but at the moſt they ſhall ſeem to rule by turns.</p>
               <p>And love being thus preſerved by the unity of an holy ſoul, the fourth condition muſt take its place, That friends muſt will and deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which is <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>honeſt:</hi> Juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt man and man, and from man to God, and honeſt, that is, of <hi>good report.</hi> I have read of one <hi>Pericles,</hi> who being deſired by his friend to ſpeak in his cauſe more then was truth, he anſwered, True, <hi>I am your friend, but no further then to the .Altar;</hi> which afterwards become a Proverb a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Grecians, and had this ſenſe, that when they ſpake as Witneſſes, they laid their hands on the Altar, which no friend ſhould dare do, no not for his friend, in a matter of untruth.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:169899:61"/>
               <p>'Tis true, that many held this too ſtrict in friendſhip, when they ſay, So much you will do for every man, and will you do no more, or have you not a caſe for a friend? To which I muſt briefly ſay, He deſerves not to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a friend, who of a friend requires, more then what is <hi>honeſt</hi> and <hi>juſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And from hence ariſeth another condition in friendſhip, That the acts and deſires of a friend muſt not ſolely tend to his <hi>own intereſt</hi> and behoof, for this is not juſt; but equally or by turns mutually to the good and benefit of each other. A picture well drawn, looks from its ſelf caſting his eyes and countenance, and as it were with them following the beholder which way foever he turns: and a friend being the <hi>image</hi> or <hi>picture</hi> of his friend, ſhould in all good deſires, wiſhes and actions, ſhew himſelf like this picture; for otherwiſe, he that loves another for himſelf, loves himſelf and not the other: for the end of his love looks inward to himſelf, and not outward to him whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to love.</p>
               <p>To the better cheriſhing friendſhip, this ſixth condition is ſomewhat requiſite, That there ſhould be as much and as often, as well may be, a mutual interview and conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween friends. The <hi>Spouſe</hi> (ſuch is true love) was at little reſt while abſent from her <hi>beloved:</hi> the whole book of <hi>Canticles</hi> proves this, <hi>Where,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ch. 1.7.</note> 
                  <hi>O where art thou whom my ſoul loveth?</hi> and,<note place="margin">Ch. 3.1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>by night I ſought thee whom my ſoul loveth;</hi> and, <hi>I will riſe, and go about the city, in the ſtreets, and in the broad wayes, I will ſeek him whom my ſoul loveth:</hi> and ſeeking, but not finding, how ſhe bemoans her ſelf to the watch-men; and having found him, ſhe holds him faſt,<note place="margin">V. 4.</note> and will
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:169899:62"/>not let him go, until ſhe had brought him where ſhe might enjoy him whom ſhe ſo much loved and deſired. Abſence and ſilence in friendſhip, are like froſt to the waters, which deprives them of their flowing and yielding their comfort to thoſe that need them; whereas the preſence and ſpeech of a friend, is to a friend like the light and heat of the Sun.</p>
               <p>I end the conditions requiſite to friendſhip, with this, That <hi>friendſhip</hi> ſhould be without end. <hi>Enmities</hi> among all, but eſpecially among friends and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> friends, ought to be mortal, every day dying; but their loves muſt be, if true and from God, immortal: Such was Chriſts love to us,<note place="margin">Joh 15.</note> as himſelf profeſſeth, ſaying, <hi>Whom I love, I love unto the end;</hi> and then as it were by way of Application, he ſaith, <hi>This Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment give I unto you, That as I have loved you, ſo ye love one another:</hi> and where he findes not love thus long-lived, but temporiſing, he blames it, as in the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> with which Church as he begins, ſo in it the onely thing he findes fault with,<note place="margin">Rev. 2.4.</note> is, That ſhe had <hi>left her firſt love:</hi> for this is the love that he ſhews to man, as by his Prophet he ſpeaks,<note place="margin">Jer. 31.3.</note> 
                  <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting love.</hi> In conclusion, True love moſt not be like thoſe Creatures ſpoken of by <hi>Naturaliſts,</hi> that live and dye in a day; or like your Pinks or Tulips, flowers of ſight and ſmell, delightful but for a few hours, but like the Oak, the Hart, the Elephant, which are long lived. In a word, it ſhould be as our wives, <hi>till death us depart.</hi>

The wiſe-man therefore ſaith,<note place="margin">Pro. 18.</note> that <hi>a friend is better then a brother:</hi> and according hereunto, Chriſt calls not his diſciples brethren, but <hi>friends.</hi> And God himſelf, to expreſs the great love he bore unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> though his ſervant, ſaith, that he talked with him as a <hi>friend.</hi> To ſum up all,<note place="margin">Exod. 33.

               <p>Now as Wiſdom, Humility and Meekneſs are the vertues, in which, as in good ſoils, we may ſow the ſeed of love and friendſhip; ſo Folly, Pride and Anger, are grounds that will never receive the ſeed of love to any good encreaſe: not Folly, for as a fool cannot judge, or rightly value the hidden parts of a wiſe man, thereby to make him his friend; ſo neither can the wiſe
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:169899:63"/>man ſee any thing in the fool wherefore he ſhould chooſe to love him. A fool may, &amp; ſo may a wiſe man play and make ſport with a fool, but a fool cannot love a fool, much leſs can a wiſe man: for the Moon changeth not ſo often as the fool doth; for his thoughts are as the ſpokes in the wheel of a Cart, ever moving up and down; and the ſecrets which thou ſhalt commit unto him, are, as the wiſe-man ſpeaks,<note place="margin">Ecclus. 19.12.</note>

               <p>And this tacit precept of loving our ſelves, is ſo much the ſtronger, becauſe it is natural, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the <hi>ſecond limit</hi> or bounding of our love, being to our neighbour, who is Gods image, and our ſecond ſelf, and therefore to love him as our ſelf: now when man ſhall ſo love himſelf, as that he loves
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:169899:65"/>no other but himſelf, then this love is corrupted and forbidden as ſinful.</p>
               <p>And into this ſin, as the firſt and root of all other ſins, did our firſt parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> fall, when the devil tempting <hi>Eve,</hi> he told her, that by eating the <hi>forbidden fruit</hi> ſhe ſhould be <hi>like God;</hi> the inordinate love to her own ſo great a ſeeming good, moved her to deſire what was forbidden, and thereby to forſake God in diſobeying his commands. <hi>Pride</hi> properly was not the firſt ſin in that <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Eve</hi> would be like God, but the <hi>love of themſelves</hi> was the cauſe of that pride.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Eve</hi> was the firſt that fell into the tranſgreſſion of not loving God through her ſelf-love: ſo very ſoon after <hi>Adam</hi> dropt into the ſame tranſgreſſion of not loving his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; for he, when God called him to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, took nothing upon himſelf, nor any way excuſed <hi>Eve,</hi> but laid all the blame and ſin upon her, which was not to love her as his friend or neighbour: and all this came from ſelf-love.</p>

Can I give any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwer, then that it was their ſelf-love?</p>
               <p>Now if you ask me how it ſhould come to paſs that <hi>ſelf-love</hi> ſhould ſo far blinde and beſot men, that by it they ſhould fall into ſuch horrid enormous ſins, the reaſon is at hand and plain: we ſay oft-times, that a man ſtands in his own light, which makes him that he cannot ſee, no not the Sun, and if a man puts his hand upon his eyes, no marvel if he cannot ſee either the object or his hand: All this and more doth ſelf-love to the eye of the ſouls reaſon; for it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents nothing to reaſon, but what it ſelf deſires, and reaſon ſeeing nothing elſe, it offers no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to be deſired and ſought by the will, but that which ſelf-love affecteth.</p>

               <p>And from this poyſoned ſpring of <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> we have our eyes ſo blinded, vitiated, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched,

               <p>THe ancient Heathen called theſe tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall goods, the goods of <hi>fortune,</hi> and this <hi>fortune</hi> they portrayed upon a <hi>wheele</hi> which is
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:169899:68"/>made to be in a continuall motion and change; others have compared them as mans life, ſo the things of this life to a <hi>ſhadow,</hi> and this in <hi>three reſpects.</hi> 1 For the uncertain or ſmall continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. 2 For that theſe when they are at their full growth or height, they vaniſh and are gone. 3 And when all is paſt, if we conſider them aright, the content or delight in them was really nothing.</p>
               <p>Some upon the words of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>By the waters of Babylon we ſate down and wept,</hi> have compared theſe temporall goods and delights to thoſe <hi>waters,</hi> not only for their ſwift paſſing away and never returning, but for the trouble in procuring, and ſorrow in loſing what we delight in, and therefore we may well be ſaid when all is well weighed to hang <hi>up our harpes,</hi> as all the joy we took in them, and for all to ſit down and weepe while we live in this Babylon of a golden captivity.</p>
               <p>It may be obſerved that in the <hi>genealogie</hi> of our Saviour, as it is expreſt by S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> the firſt of his progenitors were <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhepheards,</hi> the ſecond race were Kings, <hi>David, Salomon,</hi> &amp;c. the third were leſs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:169899:69"/>
               <p>We read in the Goſpel that Chriſt preaching to the people,<note place="margin">Luk. 12.15.</note> thought the moſt proper ſubject to forewarn them of, was the deſire of <hi>wealth</hi> and <hi>worldly goods,</hi> and therefore begins his Sermon in theſe words: <hi>Beware of covetouſneſs.</hi> And to give ſtrength and reaſon to this admonition, he tells them of a rich man who having gained and purchaſed ſo plentifully, that he wanted room wherein to lay his wealth, he reſolves to pull down the leſſer, and to build <hi>greater barnes,</hi> and ſtorehouſes, and this done he ſets up his reſt, ſaying, <hi>Soul thou haſt much goods layed up for many years;</hi> well, and what means he to do with all? Intends he them to pious and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table uſes, whereby God may be glorified, and the poor relieved? no ſuch maatter: theſe never came into his thoughts, but in ſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he ſayth he will take his eaſe, he will eate, drink and be merry.

                  <hi>He heapeth up riches but knows not who ſhall injoy them:</hi> but Chriſt ſayth, he knew not to whom they ſhould come, or, not <hi>whoſe they ſhould be,</hi> to continue with him; <hi>David</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:169899:70"/>and Chriſt have confirmed this truth, and the beſt <hi>Lawyer</hi> cannot contradict it.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>deceitfulneſs</hi> of riches touched by our Saviour,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.9.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> adds that they not only deceive us in our thoughts and intentions, but that they <hi>pierce our Souls through with many ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes.</hi> There is a <hi>comet</hi> called the <hi>fooliſh fire,</hi> which appearing in the night like a burning taper leads men out of their right way: the like ſaith our Apoſtle do riches.</p>
               <p>And yet, as if this were not all, they do <hi>pierce,</hi> the word imports that they pierce through and all round about, leaving the Soul but as one wound: and that with ſorrowes not ordinary, light ones, but with ſuch ſorrowes as overtake women in the bringing forth children, or ſuch as Chriſt himſelf ſuffered in that extreme agonie of his laſt paſſion which were <hi>paines</hi> more then <hi>ſorrowes,</hi>

                  <hi>skin for skin, and all that a man hath will he give for his life:</hi> yea God himſelf when he gave the Devil leave to touch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>, and his fleſh, yet as though he were not wining to put <hi>Job</hi> to the utmoſt triall, he enjoyned the Devil to ſave his <hi>life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that you may not think, this ſpeech of the Devil proceeded more out of malice to <hi>Job,</hi> then from the grounds of truth; heare the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher ſpeaking by the Spirit of God, who ſaith, <hi>A living dog is better then a dead Lion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccle. 9.4.</note> and he gives his reaſon for this aſſertion, for ſaith he, <hi>the Dead have no more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the Sun:</hi> ſo that as this
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:169899:77"/>wiſe min prefers a merry life before a ſad; for this (ſaith he) <hi>dryes the bones, and haſtens death:</hi> ſo he prefers, as the wiſeſt Philoſophers have done, a ſad, yea a tortured life before an eaſie death, in as much as while there is a being there is hope, but the not being at all, deprives us of all that can be wiſhed, and this is the generall <hi>dictate</hi> or <hi>vote</hi> of nature in the beſt of men.</p>
               <p>Now that ſome have, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, dared to <hi>dye for a friend,</hi> for God, or for honour or the like; this proceeded from a higher cauſe then bare <hi>nature:</hi> either it is from <hi>grace,</hi> as in the Chriſtian, or their deſire was urged and heightned by ſome ſting of <hi>ambition</hi> propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it ſelf, an immortality of name and honour, whereby they thought to recompenſe the mortality of their body by a never dying glory in the world.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding this inbred deſire of life, did man conſider and rightly weigh the brevity and ſhortneſs of his life, take it at the longeſt; 2 The uncertainty thereof, cauſed through the frailty and brickleneſs of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, and the many caſualties, cutting off and ſhortning this appointed brevity; 3 And then lay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Now the term or bounds of mans life, we find in Scriptures to be divers; for before the flood we read that many lived above nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years.<note place="margin">Gen. 6.3.</note> In the next generation after the flood the Patriarchs and others exceeded not
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:169899:78"/>much one hundred twenty years: for God ſaith <hi>his days ſhall be a hundred twenty years.</hi> And in the third generation we find this term ſhortned ſeventy,<note place="margin">Pſ. 90.70.</note> for ſo ſpeaks that Pſalme penned by <hi>David; The days of our age are threeſcore years and ten</hi> (this in ordinary is the utmoſt) and if, ſaith he, by <hi>reaſon of ſtrength they live eighty years, yet is their ſtrength, labour and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row:</hi> and although King <hi>David</hi> a man of an excellent conſtitution lived to ſeventy years (as it is computed by the beſt) yet this ſaith he, is but an <hi>hand-breadth,</hi> or indeed as <hi>nothing before thee</hi> (<hi>ô Lord:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 39.5.</note>) for would the God think of the everlaſting joyes in heaven, of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their never dying torments in hell, they both might ſay that this <hi>hand-breadth</hi> of time was as <hi>nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We read of a beaſt called from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of its life the <hi>Ephemeris,</hi> which though it live according to his appellative name but one day, yet it falls preſently to provide for ſuſtenance as though it might live years.

                  </gap> often called a <hi>day,</hi> and yet man much like that beaſt labours, builds, purchaſeth as though he were to live for ever, and although he be here but a <hi>pilgrim,</hi> a <hi>ſtranger</hi> and travailer to another place, yet like an unwiſe factor, he ſtores up all his goods here whence he is as to morrow to depart, and never tranſports them whither he is to go, there to give an account of his employment, and to enjoy his well ſpent travailes for ever; and ſuch is the folly and moſt deplorable vanity of man. Which error will appear the greater to him that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:169899:78"/>conſiders the <hi>frailty</hi> of mans life, in reſpect of the <hi>materials</hi> whereof mans body conſiſts. 2 Of the <hi>artifice</hi> and curious workmanſhip whereby it is wrought. 3 How it is ſubject to the power almoſt of every thing, to be broken and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</p>
               <p>Now the beſt and ſtrongeſt materiall of mans body is <hi>earth,</hi> and as <hi>Adam</hi> was made out of it, ſo he and mankind is called from the <hi>earth Adam,</hi> and <hi>homo</hi> man; ſo that man much reſembles a ſwallows neſt made of ſtraw and dirt: ſuch mans bones and clay, ſuch his fleſh, and how frail and eaſily broken this or that is, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear when we ſee a little boy with a ſlick to pull that down in pieces, and leſs then that, every nothing of violence to do as much to the body of man; for what of earthly veſſells ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we more britle then a Venice glaſs? yet this kept up and ſecured from violence or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward force, ſhall outlaſt two lives of any man: a <hi>China</hi> diſh ſo preſerved ſhall indure twenty mens lives. Whereas ſuch is the materials of mans body that let him diet and behave himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Galens</hi> beſt rules, let him lye warm and enjoy himſelf a bed without ſpending his ſpirits, yet even in this diet, and enjoyment without any hurt or violence done unto him, he ſhall conſume and molder away, unto that whence be was taken.</p>
               <p>Now to the weak brittleneſs of mans mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, if you add the curious nice compoſition and joyning of his parts, you may rather won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how he ſhould live a moneth, then to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile that he ſhould die ſo young; the Pſalmiſt to the honour of Gods great power and wiſdome acknowledged that <hi>man is wonderfully made,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 139.14.</note> and that ſo much beyond the art and skill of any
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:169899:79"/>the beſt workman in the world, that when any piece, pin, or wheel in the moſt exquiſite work of man may be renewed if broken, repaired if worne, and put again in its place if out of frame, yet to do the like in mans body exceeds the skill of all the beſt Phyſitians that ever were; for be the heart, be the liver, be the brain wounded, yea be they but pricked with a needle, be they putrefied or be they diſplaced, all the work is ſpoiled and comes to nothing, and mans life is loſt.</p>
               <p>But if you conſider how the leaſt and weakeſt externall things have power to deſtroy this body of man, can you ſay leſs then that he is a frail and brittle piece? I will not complain as ſome have done: yet I may tell you that God by his <hi>journyman Nature</hi> hath ſent all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſome way or other armed, or ſtrengthened into the world againſt outward force or hurt, and man only is put forth naked, weak unfenced, ſo that take him at his beſt growth &amp; ſtrength, there is no <hi>element,</hi> nor any little part of any element, fire, aire, water, or earth, though man be made of theſe, but is able to undo him and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his life. Yea a flie, a kernell, a haire hath done as much to many, and not only the living in a corrupt aire may do the like, but the ſent of a little ſubtile infection conveyed by a glove, a piece of linnen or the like, may do the ſame thing. But if to theſe we add that which both <hi>hiſtory</hi> and <hi>philoſophy</hi> confirme, that a man may de diſſolved by extreme joy, cauſed by that which is good and harmeleſs, how then may any man deny this certain and known truth, that mans life is a frail thing, or rather nothing but frailty?</p>
               <p>And not only thus <hi>frail,</hi> but a thing <hi>unſtable</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:169899:79"/>and mutable, daily and hourly, running on and making way to its corruption and diſſolution. Therefore when you ſee and obſerve the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and going down of a watch, the running of the water in a ſtream which returnes not the burning of a candle which waſts in giving light, of flowers, graſſe, leaves, which in the morning are green and flouriſhing, and ere night are cut down and withered: or will you think on and conſider what is a <hi>vapor,</hi> a <hi>ſhadow,</hi> a dream, or the dream of a ſhadow. Thus know, in ſeeing, thinking, and conſidering, theſe all or any of theſe, that you ſee, think and conſider the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall mutability and change of mans life run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and flying to its laſt end. Neither may we wiſely wonder, or juſtly complain, when we conſider this, that <hi>Abel</hi> the youngeſt of all the world dies firſt, or that in the bils of mortality we finde more children die then old men: for God in his wonderfull wiſdome and goodneſſe hath thus provided and ordered it for man, that he may hence learn <hi>two leſſons,</hi> that it is no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Gods disfavour, but an evidence of his love to take us early from the worlds miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and betimes to eſtate us in eternall felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and ſecondly, that man conſidering what a chang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>And to this end God hath ſo fixed his greater and leſſer lights in heaven, that looking on them we may daily and hourly conſider, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though to us they ſeem not to move, yet they are in continuall motion and tending to their journies end, and that it is alike in man.</p>

               <p>And further to theſe heavenly viſible leſſons he hath joyned his legible inſtructions in his holy word,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.9.</note> there telling us that <hi>the days of the life of man are vanity,</hi> that is, ſubject to change; and as though this expreſſion had not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently reached the vanity of this life, he inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth himſelf, ſaying, <hi>vanity of vanities, vanity of vanities,</hi>

               <p>And ſo, and by the ſame meanes, is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the world gained either by ſerving the wicked turns of men,<note place="margin">Acts 5.9.</note> or by mony. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> deſirous to be accounted ſome <hi>great one,</hi> and to that end that he might as the Apoſtles did work miracles, he preſently took the courſe of the world,<note place="margin">V. 18.</note> and offered the Apoſtles money: money thought he (and millions more think, and have practiſed the like) is the firſt ſtep and readieſt way to be great in honour; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to get wealth firſt, and then by it a gilded coate, a Knighthood, a Baronie, an Earledome, to be a favorite as <hi>Haman,</hi> though after all, as he to the <hi>gallows,</hi> is the worlds ſimonie or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery; What the chief Captain ſpake of his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in Rome,<note place="margin">Acts 22.38.</note> may a Mercer, a Draper, an Uſurer or Graſier ſay, <hi>with a great ſumme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny obteyned I this honour.</hi> And if a few can ſay as S. <hi>Paul, I was ſo born,</hi> yet not the tenth man, that his honour was the reward of his vertue.</p>

               <p>But he that looks upon God as unequall, or unjuſt in this, cannot ſee perfectly and aright into Gods ways: For though God advance theſe, men to high places, yet it is not truly ſo much to blazon their <hi>honour,</hi> as to publiſh their <hi>ſhame,</hi> both to the now living and to thoſe that <hi>ſhall</hi> come after them.

               <p>And ſo little is ſuch advancement to the good of the wicked, that as the Pſalmiſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſ. 35.6.</note>

               <p>It is obſervable that when <hi>Samuel</hi> according to Gods appointment was to anoint <hi>Saul</hi> King, that he firſt invited him and ſet before him as a diſh prepared and reſerved for him the <hi>ſhoulder,</hi> intimating therebythat upon his <hi>ſhoulders</hi> the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the whole land was to be layed and born.</p>

               <p>Nay further, to get and keep honour many an ambitious worldling doeth that contrary to his diſpoſition and deſire which otherwiſe he would not do: for he will make <hi>bricke</hi> without <hi>ſtraw,</hi> as the Iſraelites were conſtrained: that is, for a time he will wait, ſerve, and work in baſe employment, and upon his own pay and charge in hope of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> favour: nay rather then offend the ſuperiour powers and ſo be caſt out of the Councell or imployment, he will not dare to be ſeen with his Saviour Chriſt, nor will he come at him as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did, not, but by <hi>night;</hi> and if they of the great Councell at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall ſay <hi>one</hi> by one that the King muſt dye, theſe will be as forward to vote it as the reſt,<note place="margin">Joh. 11.48.</note> leſt the conquering Romans come and take away the honour and benefit of our places.</p>

               <p>And to ſpeak truth, though it redound to the ſhame of men, this ſin hath had more followers then any other, exceeding covetouſneſſe or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; the <hi>woman</hi> in the <hi>Revelation</hi> with a <hi>cup of fornication in her hand ſits upon waters;</hi> by which waters are underſtood <hi>multitudes</hi> of <hi>people:</hi> and that which ſome have obſerved of the <hi>Diamond,</hi> that the hardeſt of them is mollified &amp; broken by the <hi>milke</hi> of the <hi>Goat</hi> a luxurious or lacivious beaſt, holds true oft times w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt and otherwiſe the wiſeſt men; for not only <hi>Samſon</hi> in holy writ,<note place="margin">Gen. 6.2.</note> and <hi>Hercules</hi> in profane writers, but the <hi>Sons of God</hi> and King <hi>Salomon</hi>

               <p>And no marvaile, for the Heathen and their Philoſophers, as the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> held no reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, nor immortality of the ſoul, and therefore hoping for no joy after this life, they would be ſure to have it here. Yet I will not think that <hi>Salomon,</hi> though his writings ſeem too much to ſavour of this <hi>leaven,</hi> was wholly infected with this beaſtly opinion: but that his ſpeeches may be taken ironically by way of jeer and ſcorn, as that ſpeech of God is, <hi>Behold man is become like one of us:</hi> and this may appear to be ſo when you compare other paſſages of <hi>Salomons,</hi> in the ſame book with this mentioned, as if he ſaid, <hi>I will prove thee with mirth;</hi>

For as the itch in the fleſh cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth us to ſcratch, and the ſcratching procureth rawneſs with pain, and after all comes a ſcab: ſo after fleshly luſt ſucceeds both trouble and ſhame, and after this ſin, more by many degrees then after any other, be it cover of riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or the like, for after theſe ſins few cry out as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did, Woe is me <hi>wretched man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from this body of ſin,</hi> or ſin of my fleshly body: whereas this ſin of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure reſembles much the <hi>woman</hi> in the Prophet,<note place="margin">Zach. 5: 7:</note> which in a ſimilitude is ſaid to be in a <hi>great pot,</hi> be it of pleaſure or the like, but there is a great <hi>weight of lead</hi> upon the mouth of the pot, not
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:169899:92"/>only to keep her down in ſhame and pain, but alſo that ſhe cannot get forth when ſhe is once in, and that muſt increaſe and double both her ſhame and pain; that which the Prophet ſpeaks of all ſin,<note place="margin">I ſay: 57: 21.</note> is moſt certainly of this, That <hi>there is no peace to the wicked, ſaith my God;</hi> whereas the fruits of Gods Spirit abandoning and mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe luſts are <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi>

               <p>It is ſtoried of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that when he was to declaim againſt the foulneſs of this ſin of luxury, that he covered his face, as being aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to expreſs that in words, which men openly ſhewed in their actions; and it is worthy our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that the Spirit of God in the pen-men of holy writ taught them to ſpeak of this ſin in covert and modeſt termes, and ſometimes by circumlocutions, that the eares of the godly might not otherwiſe be offended, or the hearts of the wicked be corrupted: for as our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſeeing their <hi>nakedneſs</hi> were aſhamed: ſo if there be any ſhame left in man after this ſin it will appear. S. <hi>Paul</hi> by way of queſtion proves this when he ſaith, <hi>What fruit had ye of thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed?</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXIV.</hi> The love of women and of their beauty hath cauſed many evills, and therefore for themſelves alone they are not to be loved.</head>
               <p>THe love of man to woman is naturally implanted, ever ſince God made her an <hi>help meet for man:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2.20.</note> For man could not take any comfort and content in beaſts, either by ſpeech or for procreation of children: but being ſhee is <hi>bone of mans bone</hi> and <hi>fleſh of his fleſh,</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi> ſpake, <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>A man ſhall leave father and mother</hi> for her,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.31.</note> and ſo ſaith S. <hi>Paul they ſhall be joyned</hi> or glewed together, and ſhall become <hi>one fleſh:</hi> Hereupon for a man to become a woman-hater, was among the heathens as to be called a <hi>Monſter</hi> nature, or an unnaturall peece of fleſh.</p>
               <p>And this love is inflamed and increaſed by the beauty, comely proportion of the body, and gracefull demeanor of the woman, which hath been and ſo proved as a <hi>letter</hi> of <hi>recoramendation,</hi> and <hi>superſcription</hi> of favour to man, and not only Chriſtians but heathens have called this a <hi>divine gift,</hi> as ariſing from the moſt excellent temper of the ſoul, created and infuſed by God: and thereupon they conjecture the <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> diſpoſition of the ſoul from the <hi>outward</hi> beauty of the body, as judging <hi>Moſes, David,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:169899:94"/>Daniel, Rachel, Judith, Eſther,</hi> all ſpoke in Scripture to be fair and godly, accordingly to be fitted for great atchievements, or ſeverall excellent uſes.</p>
               <p>And this holds oft times ſo true, that not only Poets ſeigned <hi>Ganymede</hi> the beautifull to be the <hi>cup-bearer</hi> and <hi>favorite</hi> of their great God <hi>Jupiter,</hi> but the heathens, as the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> held their great ſights like thoſe of the Greek <hi>Olympiads,</hi> in defence of their greater eſteemed beauties; and both Greece and Troy can ſpeak much to this, which loſt ſo much blood about the beauty of one looſe <hi>Helena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Civilians have gone ſo farre in the eſteem of this beauty, that they ſay if a man promiſe <hi>marriage</hi> to a fair woman, and ſhe prove deformed before the <hi>contract,</hi> that he may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake her as though ſhe were not now the ſame wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, although only changed in countenance and complexion; and they add, that beauty with gracefull proportion and demeanor, in a poor man or woman, is <hi>portion</hi> and <hi>eſtate</hi> ſufficient to couple them to the leſs handſome, though rich.</p>
               <p>And this, with other private thoughts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, hath taught women to amend that by filthy <hi>art</hi> which hath been denyed them by God or Nature, and accordingly to beſtow much care and coſt in waters, plaſters, and paintings, to cure, colour and daube over ſcurvy faces.</p>
               <p>If you ask me how this comes to paſs, that <hi>beauty</hi> hath gained ſuch a powerfull working upon men and women; I confeſs I cannot readily ſay, whether this ariſeth from ſome se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret diſpoſition in the ſoul, ſome temper in the brain or eye, but certain it is that the man who
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:169899:94"/>hath the whole parts of a man, is delighted with the beauty and comely compoſure of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but eſpecially of a woman, though but pictured in lively colours, but then much more if her beauty and motion be living; for her gracefull moving her warbling tongue, and her ſparkling eye, oft times gives heare, fire, and life to this beauty, but above all the eye.</p>
               <p>Philoſophers ſearching how the ſight is made, whether by the ſending forth light and ſpirits from the eye, or by taking the <hi>ſpecies</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of the thing to be ſeen into the eye, they conclude that it is done both wayes: and ſo indeed in this caſe of beauty and love the eye is the <hi>witch</hi> and the thing <hi>bewitched:</hi> it is the inlet and outlet, the giver and taker of love upon beauties ſcore. In one word, it is as dry wood to take fire, and in an other like fire to ſet the wood on burning.</p>
               <p>Some have gone ſo far in the extolling of <hi>beauty</hi> as to call it the <hi>image of God,</hi> which is true of the ſouls beauty, but cannot be ſo of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty corporally ſave only in a double reflexed ſenſe.</p>
               <p>But many, and theſe not of inferiour rank in the Church of Chriſt, have been of opinion that the words in Geneſis, <hi>The ſons of God ſaw the Daughters of men that they were fair,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 6.2.</note> 
                  <hi>and they took them wives of all that they chose,</hi> were ſpoken of the <hi>Angels</hi> who fell by the ſight of womans beauty, and hence they conclude how hard the reſiſtance of this temptation is, and teach us the more ſtrongly to ſtand and labour againſt it.</p>
               <p>Now although we cannot ſay that by the <hi>ſons of God</hi> in this text are underſtood the created ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in heaven, but the ſons of <hi>Seth,</hi> who serving
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:169899:95"/>God are called his ſons, and that theſe ſaw and married the <hi>Daughters of men,</hi> that is, of thoſe who ſprang from <hi>Cain</hi> and earthly ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men: yet this we may and do ſay, that if ſight alone (for the text ſpeaks no more) wrought ſo much and ſo ſtrongly upon the <hi>ſons of God,</hi> as to make ſuch marriages, as ſoon after brought the deluge and drowning of the whole world: Then what may we conceive that tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, walking, converſing, dancing, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and other dalliances with faire women may work with the cumbuſtible matter or touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood of fleſhly man? my counſell is, reſiſt the beginning, ſhut the door or the windowes; <hi>for Death,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 9.21.</note> as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>enters in at the windowes, the eyes;</hi> and it hath been the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of thouſands, <hi>I had never ſumed had I not seen.</hi> Thus fell our firſt parents, and their whole race have tript, ſtumbled, and fallen in the like manner.</p>
               <p>And to ſtrengthen thy ſelf againſt this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, conſider that as under fair and ſweet flowers you oft times have found a venemous creature, and under <hi>gilded pills</hi> a dram of poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, ſo under beauty there may be as much, which is more to be ſhunned and avoided, then to be deſired and imbraced.</p>
               <p>For firſt conſider that though as Poets feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, fair <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> and ſo women have fallen in love with their own beauty, which hath coſt them dear, loſs of modeſty, reputation, honeſty, life and ſoul, ſo it is of no worth or uſe to the poſſeſſor or to the beautifull, but is as a picture or <hi>pageant</hi> made and ſet only for the Spectator: ſo that if there be any reall good in it, we may ſpeak of it as of that good, for which all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſenſate and inſenſate were made, which
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:169899:95"/>was for others and not for themſelves.</p>
               <p>But when both man and woman the poſſeſſor and beholder of this beauty, ſhall conſider the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſodain fading thereof, he may as well fall in love with a <hi>flower</hi> or <hi>ſhadow,</hi> as with it; for as it is like a tulip, which is of no uſe, but only for ſight, ſo is it oft times of as ſmall a continuance. So that we may ſpeak of it, as the Pſalmiſt doth of mans life,<note place="margin">Pſ. 90.</note> 
                  <hi>in the morning</hi> (about the age of ſixteen or eighteen yeares) <hi>it is green,</hi> about noon (thirty years of age) it begins to <hi>wither,</hi> but at night, at or before fifty, it is <hi>out down</hi> and caſt into the black ſmoaky <hi>oven,</hi> that ſome in pity, more in ſcorn, may ſay as of <hi>Jezebel</hi> dead, <hi>Is this Jezebel,</hi> or is this that lately admired piece of beauty?<note place="margin">2 King. 9.37.</note> ſo frail, ſo vain a thing is <hi>beauty,</hi> or a beautifull wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p>And not only is the beautifull woman fraile herein, but as weak and frail to that which is good, though ſtrong and too ſtrong, to that which is evill; For the eldeſt child of this fair mother (<hi>beauty</hi>) commonly is pride, which is as a skin blowen up with ſelf-delight, and ſcorn of others, the two naturall brats or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants of pride, as pride is of beauty.</p>
               <p>And yet beſides theſe fruits of beauty, there are others not a ſew like them; For beauty ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome begets the beſt houſewives, but makes them gadders abroade; For of what other uſe is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but to ſhew it ſelf, thereby either to inamour or inſnare the beholders; or to gain ſome windy praiſe of their ſhadow of beauty? faire <hi>Dinah</hi> will be gadding, and though ſhe ſay it is to viſit the <hi>Daughters,</hi> it is to intangle and to be taken by the men of the land.</p>
               <p>Again we ſay, as by way of proverb or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:169899:96"/>ſpeech, <hi>fair and fooliſh,</hi> (or ordinarily, not ſo wiſe at others) which proves natures equity, that if ſhe denies beauty to the hard favoured, ſhe makes her amends with wiſdome, which ſhe denyeth to the fair; But indeed the fair piece ſo much confides in her beauty, that ſhe hath neither time, wit nor will, to ſtudy the beauty of the minde, which is judgement and diſcretion.</p>
               <p>And for want of wit or judgement it often falls out with theſe fair ſnouts, that if they have not what they long for or deſire, they grow above others impatient and impetuous; <hi>Rachel</hi> muſt have <hi>children,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>elſe ſhe will dye: Herodias</hi> will not be pleaſed, no not with half a <hi>kingdome,</hi> nor any thing can content her but the head of <hi>John Baptiſt:</hi> nor will our grandame <hi>Eve</hi> be quiet till ſhe have the <hi>forbidden fruit,</hi> though it be purchaſt at no leſs rate then the death of mankind.</p>
               <p>When S. <hi>Peter</hi> counſels men to <hi>honour</hi> women as the <hi>weaker veſſels,</hi> ſome have thought that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell fit in this caſe, to temper ſuch proud luſt full women with good words and gentle uſage, as the beſt remedy: and I remember that when Chriſt was plain with S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaying, <hi>Come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me Satan,</hi> though <hi>Peter</hi> counſelled his Maſter to be <hi>good to himſelf,</hi> yet when <hi>Zebedees</hi> wife indiſcreetly would require the precedency for her children above all the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, yet Chriſt mildly anſwers her, <hi>You know not what you ask:</hi> and gives her a reaſon for his refuſall, adding, <hi>it is not mine to give;</hi> Fooles and children we ſee muſt be pleaſed or fooled with fair words, or elſe their haughty beauty will make them above others mad.</p>
               <p>That theſe kind of women are inconſtant,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:169899:96"/>fickle, and falſe, one day loving and another hating, like the <hi>Chamaeleon</hi> or the planet <hi>Mercury,</hi> which are of that colour or diſpoſition as is the plant or planet with which they are in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is ſo ordinary a theme with Poets as other wiſe men, that they have compared women to <hi>fortune</hi> which is ſaid to be conſtant and certain in nothing but levity, and inconſtancy.</p>
               <p>And if they be conſtant in any thing elſe, it is in coveting and ill getting, that they may as vainly ſpend it, as. <hi>S. James</hi> ſaith, <hi>on their luſts:</hi> and they who would more exactly know in what kind theſe luſts are converſant, let them read the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>

                  <hi>their glory is their ſhame, they are the enemies of the croſſe of Chriſt, and their end is deſtruction,</hi> in which words you may diſcover the nature,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.21.</note> the <hi>fruit</hi> (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where calls it) and the reward or end of this ſin, where the nature of it is expreſt when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>their belly is their God,</hi> and to this as the Heathens did, ſo do they ſacrifice as to their God, which they onely worſhip, with whom their temple is their parlour, their altar is their table, the Prieſts are the cooks and butlers, their ſacrifice the daintieſt of meats, and the richeſt wines, and all theſe are offered up with incenſe oft-times, muſick, dancing and the like, as in the ſacrifice to the Calfe God,<note place="margin">Exod. 32.6.</note> to their God their belly.</p>
               <p>And ſuch as the ſacrifice and the God is, ſuch we ſhall find the effect and end of all to be, and

               </p>
               <p>And how could the bleſſed Apoſtle do leſſe, conſidering that it beſots a man and deprives him of that which makes him a man, and is called the <hi>candle of God?</hi>

               <p>I need not to prove the firſt, that exceſs in eating and drinking clouds and beſots the brain and underſtanding; for what the fume and

               <p>Wine in former times in this as other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Countryes, was ſold only in Apothecaries ſhops, and was drunk in ſmall quantity to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:169899:100"/>health, but now being ſold and drunk in large meaſures to the decay of our health and eſtate, I could wiſh that the Vintners tavern might ſtand next to the houſe of mad-men, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Drunkard might either reel or be carried to his cure; for not only Poets but Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers called Drunkenneſs no leſs then mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>And ſuch a madneſs it is that makes a man forget him ſelf, in his two moſt deſirable things, in his health and life, which two while he is in his wits he moſt highly eſteems. Phyſitians not only declaim againſt exceſs in eating, and drinking, as an enemy to health, but profeſs and maintain, that a ſimple uncompounded or a ſpare diet, moſt conduceth to the maintenance thereof. For that heat which will boyle or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct a rabbet or pullet, will not do the like to beef, mutton, capon, pye, cuſtard, and other compounded meats made by the ſawcy Cook: but much of theſe muſt lye raw on the ſtomach, and the crudities corrupted and putrefied muſt neceſſarily turn to humours deſtructive to health;<note place="margin">Eccl. 31.20.</note> The wiſe man tells us that <hi>ſound ſleep cometh of moderate eating, but watching, choler, paines in the belly are with an inſatiate man,</hi> and the ſame writer ſaith expreſly,<note place="margin">C. 31.30.</note>

               </p>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> knowing the manifold miſchieſes ariſing from exceſs in meat and drink, uſeth a remedy which is worthily to be followed by all wiſe and good men,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.27.</note> 
                  <hi>I keep under,</hi> or more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly as the word imports, <hi>I make my body as my ſlave, and I bringit into ſubjection;</hi> that is, as though by cudgelling, and beating my dog,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:169899:100"/>I make him lye down when I bid him, and run and go and do as I command him; which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe my body would not do, but as an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed colt or pampered jade, it would kick againſt the feeder, and caſt down and trample upon the rider. The body we muſt remember is a good ſervant to the ſoul, thus kept under and brought into ſubjection, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> dealt with his body, but it is a moſt refractary and impetuous Maſter if by cuſtome it get the dominion.</p>
               <p>A wife, an hoſt of an Inn or Tavern, and a Civet-cat have ſome reſemblance in this, that the wife if over cockered and too full fed is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fool or cuckold her husband; the hoſt if you ever give him his asking, and not ſometime find fault and rebuke him, will grow careleſs and uſe you ill; and the Cat unleſs beaten will yeeld no musk: the application is eaſie and obvious to any underſtanding, that the body will do the like, if over fed and not kept under.</p>
               <p>And as it doth in the point of health, ſo of life it ſelf, for this life depends neceſſarily on that health, a ſhip over-laden with merchandiſe, or which hath taken in too much water, will ſoon ſink, it fares alike with mans body; for as fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and other diſeaſes are generally cured by faſting, ſo they are increaſed and death fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes upon fulneſs. It is ſtoried of a kind of Viper that comes not forth of the womb but by eating out the damms belly: ſo that belly which ſeems to give the body life, often takes away life from the body.

               <p>To theſe though men (as more effeminate then formerly) are become too ſubject, yet not ſo much as women, whoſe diſpoſitions being more inconſtant and mutable then mens, ſo

               <p>And though the man in the Goſpel be not in in this kind ſo much for the faſhion (which is the folly of our times) as for the ſtuffe,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.19.</note> yet it ſounds no leſſe then as a reproof or charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, that he beyond or beſides his calling (though probably not beſides his ability) wore purple and fine linen: but how conceive we then that Chriſt would have taxed him, had he dawbed his clothes with laces, ſtrewed them with buttons, and points, or had hanged his linen out to be ſeen about his loins, or dragling it about his feet almoſt in the dirt, and could Chriſt have pronounced leſſe of him, then that he had been a vain prodigall man, and ſuch an one who probably as he had gained his money by fraud or oppreſſion, ſo he robbed the poor of what was due to them out of this waſt: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what the Prophet ſpeaks, in thy skirts (that is) <hi>in thy garments and rich apparell,</hi>

               <p>But many ſay, our eſtates will bear the expence of our apparell, and in it we ſpend nothing but our own. And to this I may anſwer, that the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:169899:105"/>ſin lyes not ſo much in the expence of your money, (although part of this might and ſhould rather have been given to the poor and needy) as in the exceſs of apparell. 2. But may you not as well ſay, I may play the Glutton and the Drunkard, for in them I ſpend but mine own, and my eſtate will bear it; yet gluttony and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs you know are forbidden as ſins. 3 But might not thoſe Jews whoſe exceſs in apparell the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Iſaiah taxed, and the Chriſtians which S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Peter</hi> reprehend, might not they have given the like anſwer as you do, and can you think that this could have ſtood for good; as though you may ſin, ſo it be not at an others charge but your own?</p>
               <p>And yet I have heard others ſay, May we not uſe thoſe creatures as gold, ſilk, and the like which God hath given us? True, uſe them you may, for neceſſity and honeſt ornament, but not abuſe them to exceſs and ſuperfluity. 2. God gives us fire and iron, but not to burn or kill our ſelves or our neighbours and he gives us tongues, but to praiſe him, and not to blaſpheme. 3 That God who gave us thoſe creatures of wool, gold, ſilk, gave them not made into colours, laces, and ſuch or ſuch faſhions, this is the wit and often the wicked inventions of men. 4 <hi>David</hi> when King <hi>Saul</hi> was ſlain,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 1.24.</note> bids his ſubjects to weepe over <hi>Saul</hi> who covered them in ſcarlet, and put ornaments of gold on their apparell, but he bids them not cover and adorn themſelves now their King was ſlain.</p>
               <p>But you ſee that all or the moſt follow theſe, faſhions, and why not I? <hi>all ſin,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle; and will you thence infer, and why not I? <hi>and the moſt go to hell,</hi> ſo ſaith our Saviour, and will you then ſay, and why not I? Gods
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:169899:105"/>Spirit hath told us <hi>that we muſt not follow the multitude to do evill,</hi> for the evill of puniſhment will follow the evill act, and I verily beleeve that Epidemicall or nationall ſin in apparell, in part hath cauſed this nationall puniſhment of the ſword, which as the ſin growes while the ſword devours; ſo the ſword will devour till we deſtroy this ſin.</p>

                  <hi>ſhe put away her glorious apparell, and put on the garments of anguiſh and mourning, and in ſtead of pretious ornaments, ſhe covered her bead with aſhes</hi> (a ſign of humiliation with the Jews) <hi>and ſhe humbled</hi> (not prided or trimmed) her ſelf great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and thus attired, the text ſaith ſhe began to pray unto the Lord God, and toward he cloſe of her prayer ſhe ſaith. <hi>Thou knoweſt ô Lord that I abhor the ſign of my high eſtate or pride as a menſtruous ragg.</hi> And this was a woman whom God raiſed and uſed as an inſtrumentall means

               <p>But may ſome ſay, If this be a ſin, how comes it to paſs that it is become ſo generall and common? this comes to paſs, 1 becauſe the ſenſitive part or ſoul in man hath got the maſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over his reaſonable part. 2 Becauſe we look not up, and ſet our affections on heaven as we ought, but we mind moſt the vanities below. 3. We living betwixt heaven and hell, draw moſt to that which is neereſt us, which is not heaven but hell. 4 A ſtrumpet told <hi>Socrates</hi> that ſhe drew more after her, with her apparell and wantonneſs, then he did with his wiſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and eloquence: to which <hi>Socrates</hi> as gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the thing and giving a reaſon for it, ſaith, Thou leadeſt them down the hill, and the deſcent is eaſie to ſin and hell, but I draw them up, and this is hard and therefore few follow me.</p>
               <p>And a 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> reaſon is becauſe we put the day of account and the evil day of death and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment far from us: and this may be the cauſe why the younger ſort are more addicted to this ſinfull vanity then the Elder, (although many old ones offend herein,<note place="margin">Ezek. 12: 27.</note> as though they were younger) for when the Prophet threatens the Iſraelites with ſpeedy deſtruction, uleſs they repent, then they anſwer, <hi>the days are prolonged, and the times are, far off:</hi> and ſuch or worſe (though Chriſtians) S. <hi>Peter</hi> had to do with, who ſcoffingly ſaid,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3: 4.</note>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXVII.</hi> Of Favourites to Princes and People, and of Generals and Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in war.</head>
               <p>MAny towring and ambitious Spirits have made it the end of their ſtudy and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to become the favourites of Princes, or People in authority, or to be Generals and Conquerors in war, that thereby they might attain to power, honour, and wealth, though the ſucceſs hath ſeldome anſwered their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but have been rewarded according to their juſt merit, with, diſhonouoable and ſhamefull ends.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:169899:107"/>
               <p>In holy writ we read but of two eminent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, <hi>Joſeph</hi> in AEgypt, and <hi>Haman</hi> in Perſia; of whom we find that as the firſt came to that height by his piety to God, fidelity to the Prince, and an honeſt care for the publick, ſo he continued that place of truſt, and honour to his dying day, which was for eighty years; and as his death was lamented generally by all, ſo he was as honorably interred: whereas <hi>Haman</hi> through his power and greatneſs of favour growing proud, bloody and deſtructive, climbs the gallows which he had prepared for innocent <hi>Mordecai.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt time of the Roman Emperors, few were there of them but had their favourites, who they for the moſt part gained their places by ill means, and held them by worſe, as by injuſtice, rapine and blood, ſo few of them but came to ends well ſuiting with their riſe and actions. <hi>Seiavus</hi> favourite to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> declared by that Emperor his collegue and companion of his labours; yet at length the day came, wherein the riſing Sun ſaw him the ſecond in the Empire, and before its ſetting dragd by a hook through the ſtreets of Rome, and thrown from the Gemonies into <hi>Tibur,</hi> his only child raviſht by the hangman and killd, his adored ſtatua made veſſels for the baſeſt uſe, his friendſhip eſteemed an honour and a crime, and his fortune both a bleſſing and a curſe. <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſuſ</hi> the favourite of <hi>Claudius</hi> ſlain at the inſtance of <hi>Agrippina, Tigellius</hi> favourite to <hi>Nero, Aſiaticus</hi> to <hi>Vitellius,</hi> and <hi>Cleander</hi> to <hi>Commodus:</hi> each had their ſhamefull and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious ends.</p>
               <p>The corollary from this conſideration of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites, ſhall be that of King <hi>David, Put not
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:169899:108"/>your truſt in Princes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 146. 3</note> (no) <hi>nor in the ſon of man, for it is better,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 118. 8 9.</note> ſaith he, <hi>to truſt in the Lord, then to put any confidence in man,</hi> or in Princes: and a reaſon of this again he gives when he ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſ 107.40. Pſ. 76.12 Pſ. 148.8.</note> 
                  <hi>he powreth contempt upon Princes,</hi> yea more, <hi>He cutteth off the ſpirits of Princes: and will bind their Kings with chaines: and their nobles with fetters of iron,</hi> to execute upon them judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And whether Generalls and Conquerours have proved more happy then favorites, ſee in <hi>Abner</hi> Generall to King <hi>Saul, Amaſa to Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,</hi> and <hi>Joab</hi> to King <hi>David,</hi> of which three not one came to his end in peace, but had their bloud of war ſhed in the time of peace. Might I not adde to theſe in holy writ the ends of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelech</hi> and <hi>Olophernes,</hi> the former of which was brained by a ſtone caſt on him by a certain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known woman, and the latter had his head cut off by a widow. So like is victory and conqueſt to a game at cards, where that which is now turned trumpe, is at the next dealing caſt to the loweſt of all, or is diſcarded as of no uſe. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals and Conquerors remember this, when that aire which ſhould be above is thruſt into the earth, it caſts the earth into a quaking and trembling ague, but when earthly vapours aſcend into the place of the aire above it begets ſome fiery meteor or a combuſtion.</p>
               <p>It is fabled that when <hi>Perſeus</hi> went out to fight with <hi>Meduſa,</hi> his cauſe being juſt, and hers wicked, each of the Gods aſſiſted and furniſht him with armes and weapons, whereby he became the conqueror and cut off the witches head: the fable will moraliſe it ſelf into that which the bleſſed virgin <hi>Mary</hi> ſaid, <hi>he hath put down the mighty,</hi> the unjuſtly mighty, <hi>from their ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So that if we look for ſucceſſe in war we muſt be ſure not to enterpriſe it without theſe four requiſits or conditions; 1. that the cauſe be ſincerely juſt; 2. that the means be honeſt and lawſull; 3. that the end be purely good; 4. that the authority of the war be rightly veſted in him to whom God either immediatly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily hath given the ſword; as he did to the Kings of the Jews, or ordinarily &amp; mediately by the laws of man, in other ſtates; and if either of theſe be wanting it is not victory though ye overcome, but treachery, nor conqueſt, but tyranny.</p>
               <p>And therefore they who have uſed it, may deſervedly expect the fate of thoſe in <hi>Iſrael</hi> who by unjuſt conqueſt gained the crown, the ſtories at large expreſt in the Book of Kings, I ſhall abbreviate.</p>

                  <hi>The Lord is known by the judgment which be executeth, the wicked it ſnared in the work of his own hands,</hi> the proſperity of begun rebellion incouraging their trembling hearts to proceed, and the crowning ſucceſs exciting others to imitate that treaſon to the teachers deſtruction, ſo that each may ſay, verely there is a God that judgeth.</p>

All which conſidered there remains little more for us then to beleive the Scriptures to truſt in the living God, to poſſeſs our ſouls in patience, to acknowledge, that for our ſins
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:169899:109"/>we have deſerved much more, and to call upon him in prayer for a timely deliverance.</p>
               <p>Remember but as yeſterday <hi>Tomaſo Anello,</hi> the fiſherman of <hi>Naples,</hi> who for the eaſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the peoples heavy taxes, was able on a ſudden to raiſe an Army great enough to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all the power of the King, yet at laſt failing to perform what he engaged them for, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is as ſuddenly ſlain by the people as he roſe in their defence.</p>

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:169899:110"/>places, men and women ſtrove how to exceed each other in caſting ſtones, dirt and dung of men and beaſts in his face, who after all being hanged up in the theatre by the heels with his head down-ward, ſome cut off his privities, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſlaſhed off his buttocks, and other fleſhy parts, and thus half tortured and half ſterved to death he voided out his ambitious bloudy irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſoul, after which the remaining parts of his carbonadoed and loathſome carcaſſe were thrown into a ſtinking vault there to lie and rot as the body of ſome wild and noyſome beaſt, after he had tyrannouſly reigned two years.

               <p>TO the diſcovery whereof I ſhall firſt tell you what mariage is; 1. According to the name; 2. To the nature of it; 3. The cauſes neceſſarily required to the making ſuch a mariage; 4. The previous conſiderations, and the uſuall conſequents of mariage. 5. The du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties neceſſarily and juſtly required of the wife; 6. Of the husband. 7. From all which fully
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:169899:110"/>performed and accompliſht, will ariſe ſuch holy fruits and happy benefits, that may fully and rightly pronounce, that mariage, both before God and man, to be truly honourable. 8. And therefore capable of a benediction, corporall, and ſpirituall, temporall and eternall.</p>
               <p>Some ſay, our Engliſh word Mariage comes from the Latine <hi>Maritus,</hi> which ſignifieth an husband, otherwiſe, moſt of our Latine words come from the womans ſide, as <hi>Matrimonium</hi> from <hi>matrona,</hi> a matron, or from <hi>mater</hi> a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as <hi>Eve</hi> ſo called, becauſe ſhe was to be the mother of all; and <hi>Nuptiae</hi> from <hi>nubo,</hi> which is properly ſpoken of the female to be maried, as <hi>ducere</hi> is for the man to lead, and <hi>nubo</hi> is to be veiled, and ſo <hi>Rebecca</hi> when ſhe firſt appeared to <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhe put on her veile,<note place="margin">Gen. 24.65.</note> as a ſign of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, and as a note and teſtimony of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
               <p>And, to paſſe from the name to the nature of mariage, I hold mariage to be a lawfull and free conjunction of a man and woman in the Lord: for the propagation of children, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding of fornication, the mutuall comfort of each other, and all to the glory of God: wherein the materiall cauſe is, <hi>man</hi> and <hi>woman,</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall, the lawfull <hi>conjunction</hi> of them, the <hi>effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> the conſent of the perſons in the Lord, and the <hi>finall,</hi> as is before expreſt.</p>
               <p>Where note that as mariage muſt, be of man and woman; ſo it muſt not be of a man to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or, of a woman to men, but of one man to one woman, as at firſt it was betwixt <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> ſo that if <hi>Polygamie</hi> were at any time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted or indulged, yet never was it authoriſed by the inſtitution, or word of God, as to be practiſed; for it is ſaid, both in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:169899:111"/>that two, not more then two, ſhall be one fleſh.</p>
               <p>Anciently, and among the <hi>Jews,</hi> they gave money for their wives: and we did retain with us a ſmall reſemblance of the like at the time of mariage in laying on the book, or giving money to the wife, though this was not as to buy her at a price, which were beaſtly, and ſlaviſh; but to endow her (as in our Leiturgie is well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt) <hi>with all our worldly goods:</hi> but the beſt mariage is, when God brings the woman and gives her:<note place="margin">Gen. 2.22.24.</note> and when <hi>Adam</hi> freely takes her, not as a thing obtruded or forced upon him, but free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: ſaying, <hi>this is now fleſh of my fleſh,</hi> then ſhe is called a wife, and when <hi>God</hi> is not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractor to eſpouſe, the <hi>Father</hi> to give, and the <hi>Prieſt</hi> to mary them, either immediately by himſelf, as in Paradiſe: or mediately by his lawfull Miniſters, I cannot ſay, or promiſe that the mariage is rightly performed, or that it ſhall well proſper.</p>
               <p>Mariage then being a holy conjunction of man and woman in the Lord, and this to hold for life; concerns it not each, as we ſay in our proverb, to look before we leap, whether the ground we are to light upon, be firm, and good, or a quackmire, and our ruine? Our moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord, by a parable, hath taught us, that no wiſe Commander will enter into a war, before be well hath weighed, and conſidered with whom he is to encounter, and what his ſtrengths are; for as we ſay of war, that a Generall can of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend but once, (if for want of providence and, foreſight he loſe the day,) ſo much more may it be ſaid of mariage, then that of war, for if a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall hath loft the day, and be impriſoned, yet there may be an exchange for his perſon, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:169899:111"/>ſome remedy for his loſſe: but in the miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of mariage, there is no relief but death. For it is a conjunction till death depart one party or the other, and this when the Apoſtles of Chriſt heard their Lord to preach and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn, they concluded if the caſe be ſuch, ſaid they, <hi>Then it is not good to touch a woman,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat 9.10.</note> (that is) not to be married.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>Philoſophers</hi> treating of mariage, ſaid that he that would have: a year of content and pleaſant life, let him mary; but he that would wiſh to have two ſuch years, let him not mary: intimating, as ſome other Greeks ſaid, that the maried couple had but two merry days, the one in the bed-chamber, the other in the chamber of the grave, or the one, at the firſt of mariage which we call hony-moon, and the other at the buriall, ſo that with them married and marred ſhould differ but in a letter, and that as the aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>h,</hi> taken from <hi>Sarah,</hi> ſhould be added to <hi>Abraham:</hi> and that ſhe ſhould be <hi>Sara,</hi> but he with the aſpirate to be <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now though in the great pile or maſſe of women, there be many <hi>Sarahs, Rebeccas, Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gails, widowes of Sarepta,</hi> and <hi>Maries;</hi> yet there being as many, or, I fear, many more <hi>Eves, Delilahs, Jezebels,</hi> and <hi>Jobs wives,</hi> is there not cauſe, that a great care, and conſideration ſhould be had, to make choice of that woman, with whom we would be yoked, or joyned in that eſtate of matrimony till death us depart?</p>
               <p>Now the ſour eſpeciall, and uſuall promoters, or workers of mariage are; 1. <hi>Beauty;</hi> 2. <hi>Wealth;</hi> 3. <hi>Honour;</hi> 4. <hi>Goodneſs</hi> or <hi>virtue:</hi> of which the firſt three moderately deſired are good requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, for the better keeping up the ſuperſtructure in this building: but the moſt neceſſary baſis
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:169899:112"/>and foundation (without which mariage can neither pleaſe God, nor benefit man) is grace, and goodneſſe.</p>
               <p>And of theſe four promotors in mariage the 1. Beauty (for the moſt part) works upon the carnall man, the 2. wealth on the worldly, the 3. honour on the proud, the 4. grace and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue moves the deſire, and works the aſſent in the heavenly minded, and ſpirituall man; <hi>virtue</hi> I ſay and not <hi>beauty:</hi> for firſt conſider what beauty is in its nature and being, 2. what it is in power; and then ſay, whether beauty rather then goodneſſe, ſhould make the match. Now beauty, as to its firſt being, whether in man or woman, is a delightfull object of the eye, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing from the colour and figure of the body; which colour is as a fair bluſh well mixed with white and red, clearly glimmering through a tender skin, and ariſing from an equall temper of the humours, but eſpecially of the bloud well tempered; and the figure is, that comely propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the limmes, and members in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and with the reſt of the parts each to other; ſo that, neither are too long, nor too ſhort, nor too big nor too little: but that all, and each holds an equall ſymmetrie, which makes the parts, and members ſeem goodly: and now though this beauty (in colour and figure) may be accounted among the common gifts of God, and therefore it may ſerve as often it doeth, for a letter of commendation, and a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcription of favour, as being the ſigne of a well tempered ſoul, and therefore it never ſatiates the eye of the beholder, yet oftentimes like a tyrant, it is not long-lived, but ſhort of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance; for if it be blaſted with ſickneſſe, or buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feted by Satan, it is ſoon withered like your
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:169899:112"/>faireſt flowers. And yet oft-times beauty is not only deceitfull like a <hi>painted Sepulcher,</hi> or the apples of <hi>Sodome,</hi> which have only a fair ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies (yet duſt or rottenneſs within) but it is often dangerous, both to the Spectator, (becomming an infectious <hi>Baſilisk</hi>) and to the owner, as a <hi>gilded poyſon.</hi> For in many, it is little more then a skin puffed up, with a proud love of it ſelfe, and a baſe envy or contempt of others.</p>
               <p>And yet theſe beauties, as coloured flies, or well skinned beaſts, are moſt run and hunted after, though it prove to the ruin of the huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as in <hi>Samſon,</hi> and the Son of <hi>Shechem:</hi> and to the hunted as <hi>Dinah, Lucrece,</hi> and others. For as boyes love to be running after coloured flyes, to play with them to their deſtruction: ſo ſuch coloured flyes delight to be flying abroad to play in the Sun, or with a burning light. <hi>Dinah</hi> may ſerve for a motto of this embleme, and <hi>David</hi> for the word of that. Beauty is, and hath been both a ſtraggler, and a tempter to the deſtruction of others; and a reſtleſs peece de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to be tempted, though it prove to its own ruin. And beſides all this, you ſhall find fair <hi>Rachell</hi> to ſell her husband for <hi>mandrakes:</hi> which ſuch women, oft-imes love as well as their husbands. Be therefore if you pleaſe a well wiſher to beauty; but the lover, and wooer only of grace and virtue, without which beauty in an ill woman is like a ring of gold in a ſwines ſnout, and therefore of it ſelf not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
               <p>Neither is <hi>honour,</hi> to be loved whither traduced by deſcent, or conferred by the favour of the Prince, for though theſe as branches of choice roots, are left to be graffed on, and likelieſt to bring
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:169899:113"/>forth the fineſt fruit; yet even theſe by time, or taint are often ſo corrupted, that they become as blood in an ill dieted, or ſurfeited bodie, which is good for nothing but the ſewer; yea, and take honour at the beſt, yet what is it more, then a ſplended phantaſme? or airy opinion floating, or warbling in the brain of the ſtanders by? who one day reverenceth the honourable perſon as thing ſacred, while the next day perhaps he ſcorns it as prophane, yea and by a vote to be utterly caſt away as a thing both uſeleſs and dangerous.</p>
               <p>And though <hi>money</hi> and <hi>lands</hi> have a more elementary ſtuff, and ſubſtance, then either beauty, or honour; and are ſo far worthily called <hi>goods,</hi> as being inſtruments to work, and do good; yet neither are they in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves good, no nor ſo well able to make or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate the poſſeſſor good, as either honour or beauty. I find not among all the marriages, whereof we reade in the book of God, that any of them were made for wealth, and for this and many other reaſons, I cannot but condemn the too too common ſenſeleſs guiſe of our times, which ſends lands or moneys to be, or as it were, the chief Orators or contractors of marriage; or as though the ironicall words of the Poet were now verified (<hi>Quaerenda pecunia primùm, virtus poſt nummos</hi>) be he or ſhe rich, it is that we moſt look after, and let grace, wiſdome, and other beautles of the ſoul or body ſerve but as lackies, which we much regard not, whereas theſe are not to be uſed as contractors of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, they being at their beſt, but earthly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, deceitfull, or dangerous; and ſuch, as of which one may ſay, when marriage is made for theſe winged creatures, that as theſe take
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:169899:113"/>wing and fly out of the door, ſo love that was endeared for them, will ſoon creep out at the window.</p>
               <p>Mary not then for theſe, nor mary with one that is unequall to thy ſelf. An oxe and a ſheep, a lion and a calf will hardly yoke or draw together; chooſe a wiſe according to thy ſelf ſaid <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and <hi>Pittacus</hi> the like, marry one of thy own quality, for (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) equality it is, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and love to continue and grow, is beſt planted with the like roots or branches. Where I would not be underſtood, that the man or woman exceeding the other in wealth, birth; or the like, is ever to be accounted above the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that hath not the ſame in the like meaſure. But as the ſoul is to be preferred before wealth, &amp;c. ſo the extraordinary endowments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, make the perſons ſo qualified, ſuperior to thoſe that exceed in wealth, honour, or power.</p>
               <p>For cloſe, wouldſt thou man have a good wife? or thou wiſe have a good husband? know that as at the firſt marriage, neareneſs of fleſh begat affection in the ſoul,<note place="margin">Gen.2. Gen. 3.</note> (for <hi>Adam</hi> ſeeing <hi>Eve</hi> to be fleſh of his fleſh called her wife) ſo ſince that, the affection in the ſoul hath begot the nearneſs in the fleſh. For firſt they affected, and then they are made one fleſh. So that all things conſidered as premiſed, I would not wiſh the man to marry that woman that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of her wit, beauty, or birth: nor the woman to match with him, that preſumes on his wiſdome, honour, or power: for where theſe are overvalued in either man or woman, each is apt to undervalue the other to contempt, or diſcontent.</p>
               <p>In a word, the durable contractor in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is, the harmonious conſent of <hi>ſoul, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:169899:114"/>and love:</hi> and this will make and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the mariage happy, always provided that as in purchaſing land, or lending your money, you look well to get good ſecurity, and the beſt, is the honeſty of the perſon with whom we deal, and good ſureties that will ſee all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, as it is agreed.</p>
               <p>Now the firſt part of this ſecurity in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is, the grace and virtue of the eſpouſed man, or woman, of which the wiſe <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaks,<note place="margin">Prov. 18.22.</note> 
                  <hi>He that findeth a good wiſe findeth a good thing,</hi> which good thing is her inward goodneſs, and this, as in the words following, <hi>is the favour of the Lord.</hi> And of all the virtues in a woman moſt to be deſired,<note place="margin">Prov. 19.14.</note> 
                  <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>diſcretion</hi> are the chief: for this will keepe her chaſt and modeſt, this will teach her reverence to her husband, and to give every one their due, both within and without dores. And this prudence ſaith the wiſe man here, <hi>is the gift of the Lord.</hi> therefore let the wiſe ſell all, as the Merchant in the Goſpel to purchaſe this <hi>pearle.</hi> For, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this jewell, wealth, beauty, and ſuch like are (<hi>as I before cited</hi>) but as a ring of gold in a Swines ſnout.</p>
               <p>The other part of the ſecurity, for a good wife or husband, reſts on the Surety, and this is he, that is the only beſt match-maker, <hi>God the Lord.</hi> Therefore be ſure, before, and at the conſummating the mariage, to invite and get <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he was at <hi>Cana,</hi> to the wedding, and then be as ſure, that if all the veſſels be filled up to the brimme with water, which in Scripture ſignifies <hi>afflictiton</hi> and <hi>ſorrow,</hi> yet this gueſt Chriſt will miraculouſly turn them all into wine, that makes the heart merry; which is conſolation.</p>

               <p>And, that wives erre not, or come not ſhort in the performance of this duty, the Apoſtle hath been very carefull to ſet down the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and neceſſary concomitants of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, when he bids the <hi>woman ſubmit,</hi>

It muſt not be a partiall lame ſubjection in ſome things which the wife likes, and not in others which pleaſeth her not; but it muſt be perfect and totall, in all the husbands juſt and lawfull requirings: therefore,<note place="margin">v. 24.</note> as the Church is ſubject to Chriſt, ſo let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. 4. It muſt not be a falſe eye-pleaſing, or counterfeit ſubjection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her husbands face only, or in his hearing; but as that of <hi>Sarah</hi> who called him her Lord,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.6</note> and that as it is expreſt to teſtifie her ſincere and hearty ſubjection, it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.12.</note> within her ſelf, or to her ſelf, in her heart, <hi>ſhe calls him Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And all this ought to be as fully performed by every wife; as it is clearly expreſt by the Apoſtle: for it is not only the Apoſtle but the Lord that commands this ſubjection, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and therefore, not the husband only
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:169899:118"/>but the Lord God is diſobeyed, when the wife ſubmits not in all, as required and expreſt, to her own husband. I may, I muſt adde that when S. <hi>Paul</hi> commands <hi>wives to ſubmit to their husbands,</hi>

               <p>And certainly, when all this is required by S. <hi>Paul,</hi>

               <p>And yet, leſt any husband ſhould force the words too far, he muſt remember that, though the wife muſt be, as the vine on the ſide, and not on the top of the houſe: ſo ſhe muſt not be ſet in the Cellar or Cole-hole, this is not her ſeat, but on the ſide of the houſe; And, as ſhe was not taken out of the head of man to rule, or to be a ruler: ſo ſhe was not made out of the foot to be ſcorned, abaſed, or to be trod upon: but out of the ſide, as to be cheriſhed, and made much of, as being in domeſticall affairs, in the Kitchen, Parlor, and bed-chamber, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall, as taken out of the ſide of her husband, and ſet with him on the ſide of the houſe.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives ſome additionall qualities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in a wife;<note place="margin">Tit. 2.</note> as that ſhe muſt be chaſt,

Beauty in wives, oft-times, is a great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to thoſe two: and therefore though beauty be not to be deſpiſed or neglected, being it is the gift of God; ſo great care is to be had, that this beauty prevail not over, or againſt their pure chaſtity, and decently holy attire: for beauty oft-times, and in too many, begetteth pride, pride coſtly dreſſes, coſtly dreſſes gadding to be ſeen, not at home to pleaſe the husband, ſo much as to be ſeen abroad: and this gadding is oft-times the mother of temptation, temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of being ſeduced to evill and luſt: for as many beaſts are hunted, taken, and deſtroyed for their fair skins: ſo it fareth with women. <hi>Bathſheba's</hi> words to her <hi>Salomon,</hi> are worth the fair womans remembrance and conſideration:<note place="margin">Prov. 31 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Favour is deceitfull, and beauty is vain, but the woman that feareth the Lord ſhall be praiſed:</hi> let the fear of the Lord be in her eſteem her chief beauty, and then the beauty of her body ſhall not ſuffer prejudice, but be as a gracefull outward ornament, according to our proverbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all word, (<hi>gratior eſt virtus veniens è corpore pulchro</hi>) more amiable is virtue which proceeds from a fair body; and this may ſerve as a watch, and guard over the wives beauty.</p>

               <p>The great Philoſopher <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſetting down the qualities and duties of a good and fit wife ſaith, ſhe muſt be apt to rule within doores, according to the will of her husband; 2. That ſhe neither carry our, nor take in ought, againſt her husbands mind; 3. That ſhe be cleanly and handſome to pleaſe her husband, and not fine and trim to pleaſe other men; 4. That ſhe be no buſie-body in others houſes, or affaires; 5. That ſhe ſhould obſerve her husbands quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and conditions, that ſo, if they be good, ſhe may follow and teach them: if ill, to avoid them her ſelf, and, as much as ſhe can, to weed them out of her husband, or by little and little to wean him from them; 6. That with a godly and loving fear ſhe be carefull, not to give her husband cauſe of offence; and, if he be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or troubled, with diſcretion and meekneſſe
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:169899:120"/>to pacifie, and mitigate his paſsions; 7. To be a compatient or fellow-ſufferer, as a true yoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow, in all eſtates: as well in adverſity, as in proſperity. We read that <hi>Admetus</hi> being ſick, and the <hi>Augures</hi> inquired of how he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, they anſwered, it could not be but by the death of his beſt friend, which his wife hearing, anſwered, he cannot have a better friend then me his wife, and thereupon to recover him, ſhe killed her ſelf. I propound not this, as a thing to be imitated, but to ſhew of what power the compaſſionate love of a wife is, to which I might adde that of <hi>Phinehas</hi> his wife, who, upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of her husbands death,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 4.19.</note> fell in travail and died; and from theſe, and many the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, we may conclude that the compaſſionate love of women to their husbands is, as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Gent. 8.6</note> 
                  <hi>as ſtrong as death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now having touched ſome duties, and qualities of good wives, I ſhall add a few obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, or exhortations if you pleaſe to call them ſo, whereby wives may the better be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to performe thoſe duties, and to make thoſe qualities be more gracious, and ſeem more glorious.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And the firſt ſhall be, that the wife learn to be obedient to her husband, with a loving fear, as well in his abſence, as in his preſence. For, though the husband, happily, in ſome reſpects may be inferior to her: yet ſhe having yeelded to be his wife, ſhe hath withall made him her head, and it is an honour to the wife to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence her husband, that he may appear to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers worthy of honour.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond is, that ſhe be modeſt and baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, even in her greateſt deſires, and beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; fire being blown may ſeem to reſiſt the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:169899:120"/>breath, although, by it, it is kindled. <hi>Nolo ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis facilem,</hi> ſaith one Poet, I refuſe the too eaſie yeelder, and <hi>fugit ad ſalices, &amp; ſe cupit ante videri,</hi> ſaith another, ſhe fled to the covert and ſeemed deſirous to be firſt ſeen, both intimating, that a gentle and modeſt refuſall provokes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames deſires. I obſerve that <hi>Rebecca,</hi> when ſhe had travailed many miles uncovered, now approaching near the place where <hi>Iſaac</hi> her husband was to meet her, that ſhe then <hi>put on her vaile,</hi> that love, or deſire in women is moſt to be eſteemed, when ſhe ſeems to refuſe with one hand, yet ready to entertain and imbrace her husband with the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A third may be, that ſhe be not gariſh in her dreſsings, or to diſguiſe her ſelf with ſpots, patches, or paintings. I have read that a Judge, who perſwaded the husband, who had put away his wife, to take her again being ſo fair and comely; the husband anſwered, that it was not his wife, for ſhe that accompanied with him at home, was none ſuch: and indeed, though wives generally ſay, all their dreſsings and ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bberings is to pleaſe their husbands, yet I may anſwer with that of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to covetous fathers, (who pretend all their care is for their children, ſaith the father) <hi>vox pietatis,</hi> it is the voice of piety: but indeed, <hi>excuſatio iniquitatis,</hi> it is but an excuſe or cover of their iniquity. For ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve when <hi>Jezebel</hi> paints, and when <hi>Eſther</hi> puts on her bravery, the firſt doth it to appear, not to her husband but to <hi>Jehu,</hi> whom ſhe would inflame; and the other to <hi>Ahaſhuerus,</hi> whom ſhe would inamour. I pray obſerve that, when you would make the child leave the dug, you ſmear it with muſtard, or the like: ſuch are Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury waters, or ſuch ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bbers to a good and wiſe
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:169899:121"/>husband; neither can this counterfeit beauty, or artificiall dreſsing ſo much allure, or pleaſe the husband for the time, as the wives ordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar homelineſſe will diſtaſt, or take off at all times elſe.</p>
               <p>The fourth obſervation is, that wives, as they are called, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſo they ſhould be, houſe-wives. For, ſo ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Thy wiſe ſall be as the vine about thy houſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 128.</note> not in the ſtreets, or fields, but on the ſides of the houſe. The males only were commanded thrice a year to go to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> to ſerve the Lord,<note place="margin">Exod. 24</note> but not the wives, but the husbands were to go ſo far from their own homes. And the ſpouſe called his beloved a <hi>Dove,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 2.</note> which delights her ſelfe only in her mate at home, and he courtech her to ſolace her ſelf in the clifts of the rocks, not in the markets, exchanges, or play-houſes, yea when the Spouſe invites her to recreate her ſelf with the flowers, figs, and pleaſant fruits, her anſwer is, <hi>(Dilecius meus mibi,)</hi> all my delight is in thee my Spouſe. <hi>Armenia</hi> being asked by her husband <hi>Tygranes,</hi> how ſhe liked the King? anſwered, that ſhe looked not wiſhly on him, for her eyes were all the while on her husband.</p>
               <p>A fifth, may be that the wife, though ſhe be fair, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> rich, or honourable, yet ought ſhe to be frugall, and carefull for the eſtate at home. The Germans uſed antiently to preſent a yoke of Oxen to the new maried couple, intimating thereby that they as yoked, ſhould draw together, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> calling mariage (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) a yoaking together,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.14.</note> charges the man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man not to be unequally yoaked. The Greeks, when they would expreſs a careleſs prodigall wife, called het <hi>Ocnus his Aſſe:</hi> for this <hi>Ocnus</hi> being a rope-maker, that laboured and wrought
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:169899:121"/>all day, yet, before night, his Aſſe eat more then he got by his work: you may adde that, if an Oxe and Aſſe be yoaked, if the Oxe draw never ſo much, and the Aſſe hang back, ſo little good will come of their yoaking, that, as a father ſaid in another caſe <hi>(non ſolum non trahunt, ſed rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punt quod junctu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt)</hi> they not only draw not, but break what was joyned. I can conclude this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with no better counſell then that in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> Chap 31. from the 11. verſe to the 25. which I leave and commend to your reading, and meditation.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> A ſixth is, that the wife be nor apt to reſiſt, or croſly to reply againſt her husband.<note place="margin">Prov. 15.1.</note> The wiſe man in generall tells us that a ſoft anſwer (<hi>fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git,</hi> reads the vulgar) breaks anger, wherein is a myſtery that, that which is ſoft can break; and it can be no leſs then a ſecret in nature infuſed by God into the ſoul of man: and note that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man though at firſt ſhe were made out of a rib, yet that is not ſo hard as ſome bones, and it was out of the husbands rib too, that it ſhould not reſiſt him, who was the matter of her being. Fire we all know will ſoon break out by the colliſion, or claſhing of two hard matters, as iron beating on flint: but rub a thouſand weight of oyle, or feathers againſt twenty flints. no fire will iſſue: and lightning and thunder breaks the ſword in the ſcabbard.

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:169899:122"/>with a horſe bridled and ſadled; not to teach that ſhe ſhould be ready to ride and gallop abroad, but that ſhe ſhould be, as that horſe, with her tongue bridled; and ſilent at her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands command. In a word that I talk not too much in an argument of ſilence,<note place="margin">Prov. 31.26.</note> 
                  <hi>Bathſheba</hi> tells the wife that ſhe <hi>muſt open her mouth in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and that in her tongue muſt be the law of kindneſs,</hi> not ſharpneſs, or replies, but what ever the husband be, kindneſs muſt be obſerved by her as a law, and by this law ſhe ſhall find great eaſe and no ſmall benefit to her ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> For the wives gentle meekneſs, which is a ſeventh neceſſary requiſite, is like goats milke to an adamantine husband: which as is ſtoried, will of it ſelf diſſolve the hardeſt diamond, which no iron, ſteel, or the like can do. For the ſoul of man, as the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or like a ſtrong well fenced Caſtle, it may be mined, but not battered. S. <hi>Paul</hi> to win the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> made himſelf like a Nurſe,<note place="margin">1 Th. 2.7</note> which ſtills and gaines the love of the Child by lullabies, a merry note, and the dug; and not by curſtneſs,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.24, 25. Gal. 5.22.</note> or blowes. And the ſervant of the Lord who deſires to win ſoules, and bring them to Chriſt, muſt be gentle, patient, meek, for this is the fruit of the holy Spirit, which deſcended on Chriſt in the figure of a Dove; a Dove, which as they ſay, hath no gall, neither can ſhe chatter though offended, but only mourns. In a word, the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>the wife muſt be as a vine,</hi> not as a ſcratching bramble: no nor, though ſweet as a roſe, yet ſhe muſt not be pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king as a roſe: but as the vine, which brings not forth ſowre but pleaſant grapes, to make her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:169899:122"/>heart not ſad, but merry. For cloſe of this, if the husband be a <hi>Naball</hi> a churle, a fool, a diſtempered perſon, let the wife learn to be an <hi>Abigail,</hi> who would not move or ſtir him to cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler or griefe when he was in heate of wine,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25 36.</note> but after his reſt, when ſhe found him well tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then ſhe ſpeaks unto him, and gently too.</p>
               <p>I will ſumme up the duties of a wife with that precept of S. <hi>Paul</hi> which I will read as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,<note place="margin">Tit. 2.5</note> backward, or beginning with the laſt firſt, and the laſt duty here expreſt is, <hi>that ſhe be obedient to her husband:</hi> and that is to be wrought, or cauſed by the next before it, when he commands her <hi>to be good,</hi> that is, benign, gentle, courteous. The third duty aſcending is that ſhe be (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) like the <hi>tortoiſe</hi> (except on ſufficient cauſe) ever in her ſhell, (that is) an houſe-keeper, or houſewife. The duty preceding this, is <hi>that ſhe be chaſt;</hi> for this chaſtity is a great preſerver of retiredneſs, when on the contrary gadding abroad is no great friend to chaſtity. The duty firſt here placed, and which is firſt in repute and eſteem is, that ſhe be <hi>diſcreet</hi> and <hi>prudent.</hi> Which vertue is not only a great help to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve chaſtity, and to keep the wife at home; but an eſpeciall cauſe or worker of the wives cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous carriage, and due obedience to her husband: according to that of <hi>Salomon,</hi>

               <p>To this obſervation I may add one more, as the laſt to this point; that neither the Apoſtle,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:169899:123"/>nor any other pen-man of God ever commended beauty, wealth, honour, as to be ſought after in the choice of a wife. But houſe-wifery, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, gentleneſs, obedience, and the crown of all prudence, and therefore I ſhould never counſel any to make choice of a woman in mariage, who is confident of her wit, wealth, beauty or birth: nor the woman to be maried to that man that preſumes on his wiſdome, wealth, power, or honour; for when theſe are over valued in either, each will undervalue the other to contempt, or at leaſt to some diſcontent.</p>
               <p>I have been long (I hope women will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhrew me for it) in ſetting down the duties of wives to their husbands. I ſhall be ſhorter, (and I wiſh that they would not blame me for it) in the duty of the husband; becauſe as Chriſt and the Apoſtles ſpake of the law, ſo the whole duty of the husband is compriſed in this one word <hi>love.</hi> So that though under love, both in the law and the husbands duty, many things are required which are not ſimply and properly called love; yet all theſe flow and ſtream from this one ſpring of love, and this is the cauſe that S. <hi>Paul</hi> only ſaith,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.

               </p>
               <p>Now S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> (taking it for granted that the man, according to this duty and rule loves the wife, more then the wife her husband) demands the reaſon for it, and anſwers it thus. That woman was made ſubject to the guidance of the man, and therefore to make a compenſation, as it were, the man by his love is made in ſome ſort ſubject to his wife: ſo that the husband, though he be in his naturall capacity a Lord to his wife (as <hi>Sarah</hi> called her husband) yet in a ſweet manner he is, through his love, become her ſervant, ſo that though God gave the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man long haire which might be as reynes in the mans hand to guide her: yet God gave her an eye, that her husband may ſay, as Chriſt to his ſpouſe,<note place="margin">Cant. 4.9.</note> thou haſt raviſhed or taken away my heart with one of thine eyes. and be the man the head of the wife, yet the wife by her ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Well therefore did S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.</note> ſpeaking of this loving ſubject, call it a myſtery; a myſtery in nature, and a myſtery in grace, and each ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the Apoſtle to the husbands love. for, as <hi>Eve</hi> was taken out of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo the Church from Chriſt: ſhe from <hi>Adam</hi> caſt into a ſleep,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:169899:124"/>the Church from Chriſt ſleeping in Death: <hi>Eve</hi> was from the ſide opened, the Church from Chriſts ſide pierced. <hi>Adam</hi> therefore was to to love <hi>Eve</hi> as his fleſh and bone: Chriſt his Church as his blood and life. and hereupon the Apoſtle concludes, <hi>Men therefore love your wives,</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi> did <hi>Eve,</hi> and <hi>as Chriſt did the Church.</hi> For man and his wife are coupled, as in the bond of nature, ſo in the covenant of grace, and this is the myſtery which S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>the love of man to his wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And another myſtery there is couched in the words of the Apoſtle when be ſaith, that the man and wife being two ſubjects or perſons, are made and become one. for though two, yet but one body, and two, but one ſoul and affection to love each other, <hi>as himſelf:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 5.28. v. 33.</note> ſo that two ſhould be one in, and by love; and yet by the power of the ſame love this one to become two to help each other againſt all enemies, adverſaries, or opponents: and here is the myſterie, and ſuch a myſterie as love onely under God can, and ſhould make between man and wife.</p>
               <p>Which love as it is <hi>ſtrong as Death,</hi>

When the Apoſtle tells the husband that he muſt love his wife as Chriſt doeth his Church,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.25.</note> it is hereby implyed that as there can be no greater love then this, nor any greater ſpur to this love then what the Apoſtle gives, that the wife is the husbands fleſh and body: that he is her head, and that God hath commanded this love: ſo that love to his wife being ſuch as Chriſts was to his Church, therefore it muſt be a chaſt, not a wanton and carnall love: an holy, not a worldly or profane love: a ſincere, hearty, not a faigned hypocriticall love: and laſtly, not a temporary and fading, but a perpetuall love, to hold as the bands in wedlock, till death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the one from the other, or both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>And be thy love ſuch, it will ſo help, at leaſt, to temper and qualifie all ſtragling wild paſſions towards thy wife, that ſeldome, if ever, thou ſhalt be angry with her; but ſure never to be jealous of her fidelity to thee.

               <p>I might ſurfeit an husband with a glut of happineſſe, if I ſhould here repeat and inlarge the manifold bleſſings redounding to him from a good wife, of whom I may ſpeak as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers and Fathers did of health, ſaying, it is <hi>bonum</hi> ſuch a good, as without which there is ſcarce any ſublunary thing good unto him. God ſaid, at the firſt, <hi>It is not good that man ſhould be alone,</hi> without society and company (that is, to be without a woman his wife) therefore good it is to have her; 2. It was not good to be without an help meet for him, which is mans caſe without a wife, therefore it is good to have her.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is not good for a man to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out arrowes, the weapons of defence againſt his foes, now theſe arrowes are his children, which honeſtly cannot be had without a wife; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is good to have her. I could adde to theſe 600 more goods attending an husband with a good wife. But that I may not clog you, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:169899:128"/>you to that which I might here repeat and inlarge, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. from the 10. v. to the end of the Chapter, and to theſe places in <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> ch. 7.19. ch. 25.8. and ch. 26. v. 1, 2, 3.13, 14, 15, 16.22, 23, 24, 25, 26. and ch. 36. v. 14. and ch. 40.23. ſo that I may ſay merrily, yet truly, an egge is not ſo full of good meat, as a virtuous wife is of good things.</p>
               <p>And, as to the husband ſuch a wife is a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and a good thing: ſo no leſſe good and bliſſe is acquired to the wife who hath found a good husband. I have heard women jeſtingly (I hope) ſay, that if the husband be the head, the wile ſhall be the Cap: and ſurely, the wife hath no readier means to attain this, then by her diſcreet ſubjection to her husband, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of our Saviour (in ſeverall places repeated by the Evangeliſts) <hi>He that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted,</hi> and this accords with that (before mentioned) <hi>a vertuous wife is a crown to her husband,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 12.4.</note> now the place for a crown to be ſet, is his head, and as the crown is to the bearer an enſign of honour: ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour we know is in <hi>honorante</hi> formally, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently in the giver of honour, which in this caſe is the virtuous wife; and hereby ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth to her ſelf the juſt title of honour, and this ſhe hath gained by being a wiſe wife.</p>
               <p>But, if this ſatisfie not all women, then let them hear and find other bleſſings, and good things ariſing from mariage, which ſingle, ſhe neither had, nor well could have, for hereby ſhe hath not only the ſociety, but the love, the union, the body, the ſoul, the all things of the man her husband, and what greater or more good can ſhe wiſh, or deſire under heaven? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, when <hi>Adam</hi> had all the world given him,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:169899:128"/>yet it was not ſaid for theſe, or for all theſe thou ſhalt leave thy father and thy mother, but, when he had his wife, then and not till then, was it ſpoken; <hi>Thou ſhalt leave father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and all things, except God, and ſhalt cleave to thy wife: and is not this a bliſſe, or a good thing to a wife?</p>
               <p>May I not without offence ſay, that a woman before mariage, was, as it were an headleſſe thing? for, as the man was ſaid without her to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an help, or helpleſſe: ſo ſhe, without him, to be without an head, headleſſe; for ſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>The husband is the head of the wife.</hi>

               <p>And not ſingly in this, but that by this hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſhe may receive another bleſsing, that is, children,<note place="margin">Pſ. 128.5, 6.</note> for ſo it is proclaimed, <hi>The Lord ſhall bleſſe thee in ſeeing thy children:</hi> where they are a bleſsing from the Lord,<note place="margin">Pſ. 127.3 ver. 5.</note> and <hi>children are an heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and reward of the Lord; yea bleſſed is the man that hath his quiver full of them,</hi> in which bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the woman hath not the leaſt ſhare, for ſhe is the quiver, which keeps, and yeelds the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of ſuch arrowes, as are children.

               <p>And yet I cannot promiſe that this bleſsing of having children, ſhall overtake all good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and wives: no nor that all ſuch as have children, ſhall be bleſſed in them.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXIX.</hi> Of the mutuall love and duty between Parents and Children.</head>
               <p>ONe eſpeciall end of mariage is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of children, and therefore from mariage, and the duties thereof we ſhall proceed to that between parents and children: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſidering whence children come, to ſee the love and duty of parents to their children, and the return of honour, obedience and other duties of children to their parents.</p>
               <p>The Hebrews ſay, that God keeps the keyes of the womb, and of the grave, which agrees with that, that he kills and he gives life, or more neerly as to our purpoſe, children are the gift and heritage of the Lord; but by the agency, and inſtrumency of the parents: ſo that they are as ſlips or ciences taken from them, and this makes the relation between them ſo neer, that ſome have obſerved that when God ſaid, <hi>A man ſhall leave father and mother for his wife:</hi> yet he ſaith not he ſhall forſake children for his
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:169899:130"/>wife; for though the man and wife, are as the Apoſtle phraſeth it, joyned or glewed together, as made into one fleſh, yet except <hi>Eve</hi> no wife is out of, or a part of, the mans fleſh. But I ſpeak not this to leſſen the relative love between huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife, ſo much as to heighten that which is between parents and children.</p>
               <p>And this is ſo great, even in all ſenſitive Creatures, beaſts and birds, that not only the Lion, Dog, and Bear, but the Doe, the Ewe, and Hen; will oppoſe the ſtrongeſt creature, and interpoſe between them and their young, hazarding their own lives to preſerve that of their young ones.</p>
               <p>And it hath not been leſs ſeen among men, for ſo we read that <hi>Octavius Albanius,</hi> keeping a caſtle beſeiged when one cryed out your ſon without is in danger to be ſlain, he ſuddenly ſallied out for his reſcue, though with the loſs of his own life. an other hearing that his ſon was ſentenced to death for a murder, he appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before <hi>Charles the great;</hi> ſwearing it was he that ſlew the man, and thereupon was put to death, thereby to ſave his ſons life. and <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina</hi> mother of <hi>Nero,</hi> being told that it would coſt her life to have her ſon Emperour; anſwered, So he may be Emperour let me die, and how much ſhort is the affection of <hi>Jacob</hi> to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Benjamin;</hi> or that of <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Abſalom;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 42.38.</note> when <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, <hi>If miſchief ſhall befall Benjamin, it will bring down my gray haires with ſorrow to the grave,</hi> and he hearing that his ſon <hi>Joſeph</hi> was dead, he rent his clothes, put ſackcloth on his loins and mourned for him many days and would not be comforted, ſaying, <hi>I will go down into the grave unto my ſon;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 37.35.</note> and how much ſhort of this was <hi>Davids</hi> expreſſions
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:169899:130"/>for the death of a rebellious ſon, who though he ſought his fathers crown and life, yet the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thus paſſionately laments him,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 1 33.</note> 
                  <hi>O my ſon Abſalom, my ſon, my ſon Abſalom, would God I had dyed for thee, O Abſalom my ſon, my ſon?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It hath been a queſtion whether the love of the father or the mother, be the greater to the child, and if we anſwer by the conſideration of examples, we ſhall leave the queſtion unreſolved. For as we found <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>David</hi> moſt tenderly loving, ſo the like we ſhall ſee in <hi>Rachel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ge. 30.1.</note> who ſels her husband to <hi>Leah</hi> for mandrakes, whereby ſhe hoped to get children, which ſhe ſo much longed for that ſhe cries out, <hi>give me children elſe I dye,</hi> and having loſt them, ſhe weeps for them,<note place="margin">Jer. 31.15 Mat. 1.8.</note> 
                  <hi>and would not be comforted becauſe they were not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if we conſider the mothers pain in bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, danger in bringing forth, and her care and trouble in their firſt training up, we may conceive that her love exceeds, eſpecially if we add hereunto that which the Prophet ſaith, if a mother, (he ſaith not if a father) but if a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>can forget the child of her womb,</hi> which may ſeem to intimate, that a father may ſooner for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the ſon which he got, then the mother which bore him in her womb: which womb nature as the Anatomiſts obſerve hath filled with moſt tender affectionate baggs, membranes, veines, and ſinewes; thereby to make her more loving to the child,<note place="margin">Gen. 29.32.</note> and if to this we add what <hi>Leah</hi> ſpeaks, who having born a ſon unto <hi>Jacob</hi> her husband, ſhe ſaith <hi>now my husband will love me;</hi> Then we may conclude that the mother for her own ſake loves the child more tenderly or fondly, but the father for the childs ſake loves him more wiſely and ſtrongly; or we may ſay, that
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:169899:131"/>the man and the woman, love their child, as <hi>Alexander</hi> was ſaid to love his two intimate friends, <hi>Epheſtion</hi> and <hi>Parmenio,</hi> who loved the former as a fine delicate man, and ſuch women delight in, but <hi>Parmenio</hi> he loved as a brave man for action, and ſuch a wiſe father is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with.</p>
               <p>And from hence we may aſſoile an other queſtion, why both father and mother oft-times loves one child better then an other, as <hi>Rebecca</hi> did <hi>Jacob</hi> the younger, more then <hi>Eſau</hi> the elder; I and <hi>Jacob</hi> affected his two youngeſt, <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> more then his firſt born, <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Simeon,</hi> and King <hi>David</hi> placed the crown on the head of <hi>Salomon</hi> contrary to the Jews law and cuſtome, though he had ſix ſons elder then <hi>Salomon;</hi> and a great part of this act in King <hi>David</hi> we may aſcribe to the affection, policy and power of <hi>Batſheba</hi> the mother, as that other the like act of <hi>Iſaac</hi> in preferring <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Eſau</hi> may be attributed to <hi>Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now from this root of love in the parents, ſhoot out the branches of their care in nurſing, breeding, and providing for their children; all which are ſo naturall and neceſſary, that who neglects the performance of theſe duties deſerves not the name of father and mother, nor yet ſo much as to be called Syre, or Damme, for beaſts and birds generally performe theſe cares for their young, untill they are able to provide for themſelves: for did we ever know or read that an Ewe, a Doe, or a Sow, put out her young to nurſe, or would ſuffer any other to give their young ſuck, but themſelves ſo long as themſelves were able to do it? and muſt we conceive that nature hath leſs power, or works
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:169899:131"/>leſs in a woman which hath reaſon then in a beaſt? or will ye have me think that reaſon and grace which add unto, and ſtrengthen the gifts of nature, do both weaken nature in the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? and if not, which indeed cannot be thought by any indued with grace or reaſon, why then think we that nature hath given the mother breaſts, and fountains of milk if not to ſuckle her young? or why think ye that a ſtrange womans milk ſhould be ſo naturally and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly good for the child as the mothers which brought it into the world? and why rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider you not that as children with the milk, draw that humour which makes for the good or ill of their bodies, ſo many by ſucking cruell, drunken, unchaſt women, have become ſuch in quality and condition as their nurſes were? It may be inſtanced in <hi>Tiberius, Commodus,</hi> Emperors of Rome, and divers others: but not to be long on this ſubject, remember that <hi>Sarah</hi> is ſaid to have given her ſon ſuck, from which act I ſhall draw no other inference but that of S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet: 3.6</note> 
                  <hi>whoſe Daughters ye are as long as ye do well</hi> (doing as ſhe did who gave ſuck to her child.)</p>
               <p>But the mothers duty ends not in this, but that ſhe with the husband and each and both muſt labour with the ſooneſt to adminiſter the ſpirituall milk of the knowledge and fear of God, thereby to nouriſh the childs ſoul to everlaſting life; and this duty lies more ſtraightly, and ſtrongly, upon the parent in as much as the ſoul the Temple of God is more excellent &amp; of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſteem then the body, which is but an houſe of clay.

               <p>And yet to this admonition leſt Parents grow too ſevere and rigid I muſt give this caution, that Parents be not like <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to threaten or uſe ſcorpions, that is, whips having ſharp thongs like points of thorns or ſtings of Serpents, but ever that they remember the counſell of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Eph. 6.4.</note>

               </p>
               <p>But to this duty of Parents providing for children, I muſt give a memento or two which may concern the parent and ſome other, that may reſpect the child; to that which concerns the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, we have a proverb or by-word, Happy is that child whoſe father goes to the Devill, and I remember when <hi>Rebecca</hi> intended in love to <hi>Jacob</hi> the younger to rob <hi>Eſau</hi> the elder and and the heir of his birth-right, <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid to his mother, by this fraudulent and falſe way I ſhall bring a curſe upon my ſelf and not a bleſsing, but what is the mothers reply? <hi>upon me be the curſe my ſon,</hi> ſo I make thee great and Lord of all; but worthily deſerves that Parent the curſe, and juſtly is he rewarded with hell, who fears neither the curſe nor hell, ſo he can make his ſon rich and great.</p>
               <p>A learned Father of the Church,<note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the immoderate raking together of riches in many men, was anſwered by theſe
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:169899:133"/>men, that all they did was for their children, and every man was bound by Gods law to provide for them: whereunto be replyed, this ſeems to be the voice of piety, but indeed it is the excuſe of iniquity, and better it were your children ſhould want wine, then you water to cool your tongue, or better they ſhould want fire here, then you ſhould burn in hell here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>But certainly if Parents were ſo beſotted with their love to their children as to hazard their own everlaſting damnation and torture for their children, yet did they conſider how little benefit theſe ill gotten goods bring to their children and poſterity in the end they would not be ſo hell-hardy as they are, for hear what the Prophet ſpeaks,<note place="margin">Pſal. 37.35.36.</note>

               <p>Therefore Fathers that your eſtates may prove durable to your children and comfortable to your ſelves, get them in the fear of God and by honeſt, and juſt means, and in the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of them be juſt and equall, not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all or the moſt of all to one for the raiſing or propagating a name, and little to the reſt. I
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:169899:134"/>am not ignorant that diverſe people doe it and herein they do right well, becauſe herein they ſeem to imitate the <hi>Jews</hi> who indeed left thoſe lands in <hi>Canaan</hi> which came unto them and were divided by lot, theſe for the moſt part as by preſcription or law deſcended to the elder, and again becauſe the elder among them both in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and civill affairs and titles had the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence before and above the younger.

               <p>Yet ſo, that all may be as heirs of their Fathers ſpirituall, ſo of his earthly and temporall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and that with ſome indifferent meaſure and proportion. For although a river cut and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into many ſtreams runs not ſo ſtrongly nor makes ſo great a ſhew or noiſe, yet thus divided
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:169899:134"/>it doeth leſſe harm by breaches or overflowings, and more good by watering and refreſhing the land. And I am ſure, that an houſe, bridge, or caſtle, built or ſetled upon moſt arches but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes or piles of ſtone ſtands more firmely and for continuance then that which ſtands but upon one; for if this one failes as oft it is ſeen in the heirs of <hi>England,</hi> all the houſe falls to decay with him and is gone.</p>
               <p>Now if two ſtrings to the bow holds ſureſt, then ſay I why not to have two, three or four, rather then to truſt all to one? but if you ſhall adde hereunto, the heart-burnings, contentions, troubles and wars not only between <hi>Davids</hi> children, or <hi>Iſaacs,</hi> or between the <hi>Edomites</hi> and <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the iſſue and poſterity of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> but of thouſands more upon unequall diſtributions, you will ſoon conclude that it is neither wiſe, good nor ſafe to give all or moſt of all to one becauſe he is the elder, but either to give the moſt to the beſt or proportionally to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it among all.</p>

               <p>I could adde hereunto that among all puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted upon capitall offenders, that next to death was generally accounted baniſhment, by which I mean not an amandation, ſending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way or ſequeſtring a man from his own houſe within his own countrey, which was not much feared or declined, but an exile, caſting out or driving away from his native ſoile.</p>
               <p>Neither held this ſo among men alone, but it was denounced by God himſelf as a moſt ſevere puniſhment and ſign of his heavy wrath againſt the King <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 22.</note> that he ſhould not return home from captivity to bis own countrey.</p>
               <p>Nay I could inſtance in divers both wiſe and noble Spirits who have deſired rather preſently to dye and ſo to be buried in their own then to prolong their lives, and after it to be interred in a ſtrange countrey, eſteeming themſelves better laid in a grave in their own countrey and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their own houſe.</p>

               <p>A <hi>Philoſopher</hi> being asked, what a man ought to doe to a wicked rebellious country an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered you muſt deal with it as with your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom you muſt never deſpiſe but honour and make her better if you can, but never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake her: and accordingly we have read of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers who have rejected parents, wives, children, when grown to exceſs of impiety or iniquity, yet ſo it comes to paſs that even for the moſt crying ſinnes few or none caſt off their country. Think on <hi>Lot,</hi> who rather then forſake his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey he muſt be forced out of it by an Angel of heaven, as rather hazarding to burn in his own country then to live in a better.</p>
               <p>I could adde to all this, that Chriſt himſelf ſo farre teſtified the love he bore to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> the village and <hi>Nazareth</hi> the region of his birth and education, that he reſorted often to them la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring their converſion, and bewailed himſelf as it were for this, that through their unbeleef he did no miracles among them.</p>
               <p>But briefly to cloſe all, I ſhall deſire you to read two Pſalmes, in the one whereof you may plainly ſee how the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> though they enjoyed Gods gracious preſence and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table aſſiſtance in <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 137.</note> yet how they mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the abſence from their own country, and in the other you ſhall as apparently diſcover the wonderfull extreme joy they took in being reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red home again.<note place="margin">Pſ. 126.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For being out of their country, ſaith the text, <hi>They ſate down and wept when they remembred Zion,</hi> yea they hanged up their harpes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumens of joy, and muſick to the Lord, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing they could not ſing the Lords ſong in a ſtrange land; and yet though this they could not do for grief, yet for loves ſake they wiſhed to
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:169899:139"/>forget their cunning if ever they forgat <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> yea they wiſhed <hi>that their tongue might cleave to the roof of their mouth,</hi> and that they might never ſpeak if they did not remember, nay if they did not prefer <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above their Chief or choice joy.</p>
               <p>And as their grief was ſuch for the loſſe, now ſee if as great joy were not conceived by them for the regaining of their beloved country, for now they ſay being returned we rejoyce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and not only rejoyce, but our joy is ſuch as if it were a dream which coming ſuddenly and unexpectedly makes men l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If you beleeve not me, hear themſelves ſpeak their own joy when they ſay, <hi>Then was our mouth filled with laughter and our tongue with ſinging,</hi> inſomuch that among the Heathen they ſaid, <hi>The Lord hath done great things for us,</hi> that is, our return home to <hi>Judea,</hi> is ſuch an act that none could have wrought for us but the Lord, and thereof we are glad.</p>
               <p>The Grecians held that to be their country where they thrived beſt and got moſt, yea it was a Proverb among both Greeks and Romans, That is a mans country where it is well with him, or where he doeth well. Now if this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall country of ſmoaky unſavory earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low be ſo ſweet and pleaſing to the corporall, what then muſt that other heavenly glorious country above be unto the ſpirituall man? for man as he conſiſts of two parts body and ſoul, and in that regard man may be termed a double, that is, an earthly and a ſpirituall man, which

               <p>All this and much more will be evident to any ordinary underſtanding that will read the Apoſtle where he thus ſpeaks: <hi>Abraham</hi> when he was ſent by God from his own to a ſtrang coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.9</note> obeyed; for he looked for a city, &amp; confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf a ſtranger &amp; pilgrim on the earth,<note place="margin">ver. 10. ver. 13.</note> he declareth plainly that he ſought a country, and this country is called the better and the heavenly country: and in this country God hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all his faithfull ſeed,<note place="margin">ver. 16.</note> ſaith the text, a city, a <hi>City</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>which hath foundations</hi> (as though this of the earth were inſtable) and ſuch foundations as whoſe builder and maker is God.</p>
               <p>And if you will further know and ſee the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this city in this heavenly country with the excellent company, and joy there to be found, then read forward where the Apoſtle faith, <hi>Yee are now in the City of the living God, the heavenly Jeruſalem,</hi>
